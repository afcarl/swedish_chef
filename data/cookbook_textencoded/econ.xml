With this sponge you may make a large or a small quantity of bread by adding <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>water</ingredient> or <ingredient>milk;</ingredient> if a small quantity, it may be put into the oven very soon; if the quantity be large, it must stand longer, or over night. Put in double the usual quantity of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> but no shortening. Let the dough stand in a place moderately warm, but not near the fire, unless it is to be baked immediately. <ingredient>Milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>water</ingredient> may be used, but <ingredient>water</ingredient> is the best, for the sponge mixed with <ingredient>water</ingredient> keeps sweet the longest. The bread will be very light, sweet, and wholesome, having in it neither acids nor alkalies, to neutralize each other. The greater the proportion of <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> the lighter the bread will be; but if the proportion is very large, the bread will be so light as to dry up, if kept several days.</p>

<p>Boil a single handful of <ingredient>hops</ingredient> (which every farmer can and ought to raise, to the extent of household wants) in two or three quarts of <ingredient>water;</ingredient> strain and thicken the liquor, when hot, with <ingredient>rye flour;</ingredient> then add two or three small <ingredient>yeast cakes,</ingredient> to set the mass. If this is done at evening, it will be fit for use early next morning. Reserve a pint of this yeast, which thicken with <ingredient>Indian meal,</ingredient> make into small cakes the size of crackers, and dry them in the shade for future use. In this way the yeast is always fresh and active. Yeast cakes kept a long time are apt to become rancid, and lose their virtues. The fresher the cakes, the better the yeast.</p>

intended for smoking and drying, may be cured according to this mode, and will be found excellent.</variation> Much of the goodness of <ingredient>hams</ingredient> depends on smoking. They should be hung at such a distance from the fire as not to be heated. They should be hung up with the shank-end downward, as this will prevent the escape of their juices by dripping. Small <ingredient>hams,</ingredient> wanted for immediate use, will answer with two weeks' smoking; but larger ones, and those wanted for keeping, should be smoked four weeks or more.</p>



<p>Different articles are used for smoking. Perhaps saw-dust from hard wood, where it can be conveniently had, is, on the whole, to be preferred. Corn-cobs are first rate, and are said by some to make the "sweetest" smoke of any thing. Chips of maple and hickory, or the small twigs and branches of those kinds of wood, do well.</p>

The barrels are smoked by being placed over small fires of chips, cobs, &amp;c., for several hours. The essence of smoke which is thus imbibed by the barrel is imparted to the pickle, and thence to the meat.</variation></p>
