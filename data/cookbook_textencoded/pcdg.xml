from the fire, leave it five minutes, and then strain it; after which, put it



in pots, and keep them in a dry and cool place; cover the pots well every time



you have occasion to use, but never cover them while the grease is warm. This

<p><purpose>Boning</purpose> is not a difficult operation. It only requires



time, a thin, sharp knife, and a little care. Cut off the neck, and also the



legs at the first joint. Cut the skin in a line down the middle of the back.



Now, taking first one side and then the other of the cut in the fingers,



carefully separate the flesh from the bones, sliding the knife close to the



bone. When you come to the wings and legs, it is easier to break or unjoint the



bones at the body-joint; cutting close by the bone, draw it, turning the flesh



of the legs and wings inside out. When all the bones are out, the skin and



flesh can be re-adjusted and stuffed into shape. As the leg and wing bones



require considerable time to remove, they may be left in, and the body stuffed



with <ingredient>lamb or veal force-meat.</ingredient> See receipt for boned

<p>Put a heaping table-spoonful of <ingredient>hops</ingredient> and a quart of



<ingredient>hot water</ingredient> over the fire to boil. Have ready five or



six large boiled <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> which mash fine. Strain the

<ingredient>salt.</ingredient>When this is lukewarm, mix in one and a half 



<ingredient>Twin Brothers' yeast-cakes</ingredient> (softened). Let this stand



overnight in a warm place.</p>



<p>In the morning, a new process is in order: First, pour over the 



<ingredient>yeast</ingredient> a table-spoonful of <ingredient>warm



water,</ingredient> in which is dissolved half a spoonful of 



<ingredient>soda;</ingredient> mix in lightly about ten and a half heaping



tea-cupfuls of sifted <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> No more 



<ingredient>flour</ingredient> is added to the bread during its kneading.



Instead, the hands are wet in <ingredient>lukewarm water.</ingredient> Now



knead the dough, giving it about eight or ten strokes; then taking it from the



side next to you, pull it up into a long length, then double it, throwing it



down 



<emph rend="italic">snappishly</emph> and heavily. Wetting the hands again,



give it the same number of strokes, or 



<emph rend="italic">kneads,</emph> pulling the end toward you again, and



throwing it over the part left in the pan. Continue this



<pb n="66" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=72"/> process until large bubbles are formed in the



dough. It will take half an hour or longer. The hands should be wet enough at



first to make the dough rather supple. If dexterously managed, it will not



stick to the hands after a few minutes; and when it is kneaded enough, it will



be very elastic, full of bubbles, and will not stick to the pan. When this time



arrives, put the dough away again in a warm place to rise. This will take one



or two hours.</p>



<p>Now comes another new process. Sprinkle plenty of 



<ingredient>flour</ingredient> on the board, and take out lightly enough dough



to make one loaf of bread, remembering that the French loaves are not large,



nor or the same shape as the usual home-made ones. With



the<illustration><description>An illustration of an oval-shaped lump of



dough.</description></illustration>thumb and forefinger gather up the sides



carefully (to prevent doubling the meshes or grain of the dough) to make it



round in shape. Flour the rolling-pin, press it in the centre, rolling a little



to give the dough the form of cut.</p>



<p>Now give each puffed end a roll toward the centre, lapping well the ends.



Turn the bread entirely over, pulling out the ends a little, to give the loaf a



long form, as in cut.</p><illustration><description>An illustration of a long

<p>Sprinkle plenty of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> on large 



<implement>baking-pans</implement> turned bottom side up, upon which lay this



and the other loaves, a little distance apart, if there is room for two of them



on one pan. Sprinkle plenty of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> on the tops, and



set the pans by the side of the fire to again rise a little. It will take



twenty-five or thirty minutes longer. Then bake.</p>



<p>Kneading bread in the manner just described causes the 



<emph rend="italic">grain</emph> of the bread to run in one direction, so that



it may be pealed off in layers. Kneading with

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TOAST.</purpose>I have remarked



before that not one person in a thousand knows how to make good toast. The



simplest dishes seem to be the ones oftenest spoiled. If the cook sends to the



table a properly made piece of toast, one may judge that she is a 



<emph rend="italic">scientific</emph> cook, and may entertain, at the same



time, exalted hopes of her.</p>



<p>The <ingredient>bread</ingredient> should not be too fresh. It should be



cut<emph rend="italic">thin,</emph> evenly, and in good shape. The crust edges



should be cut off. The pieces shaved off can be dried and put in the



bread-crumb can. The object of toasting <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is to



extract all its moisture--to convert the dough into pure farina of wheat, which



is very digestible. Present each side of the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> to



the fire for a few moments to 



<emph rend="italic">warm,</emph> without attempting to toast it; then turn



about the first side at some distance from the fire, so that it may slowly and



evenly receive a 



<emph rend="italic">golden</emph> color all over the surface. Now turn it to



the other side, moving it in the same way, until it is perfectly toasted. The



coals should be clear and hot. Serve it the moment it is done, on a warm plate,



or, what is better, a <implement>toast-rack;</implement> consequently, do not



have a piece of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> toasted until the one for whom



it is intended is ready to eat it.</p>



<p>"If, as is generally done, a thick slice of <ingredient>bread</ingredient>is



hurriedly exposed to a hot fire, and the exterior of the 



<ingredient>bread</ingredient> is toasted nearly black, the intention of



extracting the moisture is defeated, as the heat will then produce no effect on



the interior of the slice, which remains as moist as ever. Charcoal is a bad



conductor of heat. The overtoasted surface is nothing more or less than a thin



layer of charcoal, which prevents the heat form penetrating through the 



<ingredient>bread.</ingredient> Neither will 



<ingredient>butter</ingredient>pass through the hard surface: it will remain on



it, and if exposed to heat, to melt it in, it will dissolve, and run over it in



the form of rancid oil. 



<emph rend="italic">This</emph> is why buttered toast is so often



unwholesome."</p>

<p>The <ingredient>water</ingredient> should be salted and boiling when the

is necessary to keep it from burning at the bottom, and to mingle the grains



two or three times, so that they may all be evenly cooked. If much stirred, the



porridge will be starchy or waxy, and poor in flavor. But the puffing of the



steam through the grains without much stirring swells each one separately, and,



when done, the porridge is light, and quite consistent. This same manner of



cooking is applicable as well to all other grains.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">AMBER SOUP, OR CLEAR



BROTH.</purpose>This soup is served at almost all company dinners. There can be



no better choice, as a heavy soup is not then desirable.</p>



<p>Ingredients: A large <ingredient>soup bone</ingredient> (say two pounds), a 



<ingredient>chicken,</ingredient> a small slice of 



<ingredient>ham,</ingredient> a <ingredient>soup bunch</ingredient> (or an 



<ingredient>onion,</ingredient> two sprigs of 



<ingredient>parsley,</ingredient>half a small <ingredient>carrot,</ingredient>



half a small <ingredient>parsnip,</ingredient> half a stick of 



<ingredient>celery</ingredient>), three <ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> 



<ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> a gallon of 



<ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> <ingredient>whites and shells of two



eggs,</ingredient> and <ingredient>caramel</ingredient> for coloring.</p>



<p>Let the <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> <ingredient>chicken,</ingredient> and



<ingredient>ham</ingredient> boil slowly for five hours; add the vegetables and



<ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> to cook the last hour, having first fried the 



<ingredient>onion</ingredient> in a little hot <ingredient>fat,</ingredient>and



then in it stuck the <ingredient>cloves.</ingredient> Strain the soup into an



earthen bowl, and let it remain overnight. Next day remove the cake of fat on



the top; take out the jelly, avoiding the settlings, and mix into it the beaten



<ingredient>whites of the eggs with the shells.</ingredient> Boil quickly for



half a minute; then, placing the kettle on the hearth, skim off carefully all



the scum and <ingredient>whites of the eggs</ingredient> from the top, not



stirring the soup itself. Pass this through the <implement>jelly



bag,</implement> when it should be quite clear. The soup may then be put aside,



and reheated just before serving. Add then a large table-spoonful



<pb n="82" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=88"/> of <ingredient>caramel,</ingredient> as it gives



it a richer color, and also a slight flavor.</p>



<p>Of course, the brightest and cleanest of kettles should be used. I once saw



this transparent soup served in Paris, without color, but made quite thick with



<ingredient>tapioca.</ingredient> It looked very clear, and was exceedingly



nice.</p>



<p>This soup may be made in one day. After it is strained, add the 



<ingredient>eggs</ingredient> and proceed as in receipt. However, if it is to



be served at a company dinner, it is more convenient to make it the day



before.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO MAKE CARAMEL, OR BURNED



SUGAR, FOR COLORING BROTH.</purpose>The appearance of broth is improved by



being of a rich amber color. The most innocent coloring substance, which does

<p>Put into a porcelain saucepan, say half a pound of 



<ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and a table-spoonful of

<recipe class1="meatfishgame">



<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">FILLET OF BEEF.</purpose>I will



be very specific about the <ingredient>fillet of beef,</ingredient> as it is



easily managed at home, and is very expensive ordered from the 



<emph rend="italic">restaurateur.</emph> His price is generally ten dollars for



a dressed and cooked <ingredient>fillet of beef</ingredient> for a dinner for



ten or twelve persons. To buy it from the butcher costs a dollar a pound when



dressed; three pounds are quite sufficient for ten or twelve persons. To lard



it (an affair of ten minutes) would cost ten cents more; a box of 



<ingredient>French canned mushrooms,</ingredient> an additional forty cents; a



little <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> five cents.</p>



<p>One sees a <ingredient>fillet of beef</ingredient> at almost every dinner



party. "That same fillet, with mushrooms," a frequent diner-out will say. I



hope to see it continued, for among the substantials there is nothing more



satisfactory.</p>



<p>A good butcherw ill always deliver a <ingredient>fillet of



beef</ingredient>already dressed; if, however, it is necessary to have it



dressed at home, the 



<emph rend="italic">modus operandi</emph> is as follows:</p>



</recipe>



<recipe class1="meatfishgame">



<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO TRIM A FILLET OF



BEEF.</purpose>The fillet is the under side of the <ingredient>loin of



beef.</ingredient> The <ingredient>steaks</ingredient> cut from this part are



called <ingredient>porter-house-steaks.</ingredient> This under side, or



fillet, is covered with skin and fat. "All the skin and fat must be removed



from the top of the fillet, from one end to the<pb n="134"



id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=140"/>other; then the rib-bones are disengaged. The fat adhering to



the side opposite the ribs is only partially removed. Now the sinewy skin



covering the upper <ingredient>meat</ingredient> of the fillet must be removed



in strips, proceeding by slipping the blade of the knife between the skin and



the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> This operation is very simple; yet it



requires great precision. The upper part of a trimmed fillet must be smooth, 



<emph rend="italic">i.e.,</emph> must not be furrowed by hollows occasioned by



wrong movements of the knife. The skin being removed, both extremities of the



fillet are rounded. The fat inside the rib is the only portion of fat allowed



to adhere to the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> The larding of the 



<ingredient>meat</ingredient> is applied to its upper surface."</p>



</recipe>



<recipe class1="meatfishgame">



<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO COOK A FILLET OF

and <ingredient>pepper</ingredient>over it, and put a large ladleful of hot 



<ingredient>stock</ingredient> into the bottom of the pan, or it may be simply



basted with <ingredient>boiling water.</ingredient> Half an hour (if the oven



is very hot, as it should be) before dinner, put it into the oven. Baste it

<p>French cooks often braise a <ingredient>fillet of beef.</ingredient> I do

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">BEEFSTEAK.</purpose>The 



<ingredient>porter-house and tenderloin steaks</ingredient> are best. Of



course, there is great difference in the different cuts of these 



<ingredient>steaks.</ingredient> For a cheap <ingredient>steak,</ingredient> a



good cut of what it called <ingredient>chuck-steak</ingredient> is best. It has



more flavor and juice, and is more tender than the 



<ingredient>round-steak,</ingredient> costing the same price.</p>



<p>Have the choice <ingredient>steaks</ingredient> cut half an inch thick at



least; they are even better three-quarters of an inch thick. Grease the 



<implement>gridiron</implement> well with <ingredient>pork or



beef-suet.</ingredient> Have it quite hot. Put on the 



<ingredient>steak</ingredient> over a hot, clear fire; cover it with a 



<implement>baking-pan.</implement> In a moment, when the 



<ingredient>steak</ingredient> is colored, turn it over. Watch it constantly,



turning it whenever it gets a little brown. Do not stick the fork into the



middle of the <ingredient>steak,</ingredient> only into the sides,



<pb n="138" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=144"/> where it will do least harm by letting out the



juice. It should be quite rare or pink in the centre, though not 



<emph rend="italic">raw.</emph> When cooked enough, put it on a hot platter;



sprinkle over plenty of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and 



<ingredient>pepper</ingredient>--mind not to put on the 



<ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> before the 



<ingredient>steak</ingredient> is cooked; then spread over the top some sweet,



fresh <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Set the platter in the oven a few



moments, to let the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> soak a little in the 



<ingredient>steak;</ingredient> then serve it immediately. Do not use too much 



<ingredient>butter;</ingredient> there should be none at all, or at least only



a few stray drops, in the bottom of the platter. There should be no gravy. The



juice of a properly cooked <ingredient>steak</ingredient> is supposed to be in



the inside of the <ingredient>steak,</ingredient> and not swimming in the



dish.</p>



<p>A <ingredient>steak</ingredient> is much improved by a simple addition,



called by professional cooks 



<emph rend="italic">&#224; la ma&#238;tre d'h&#244;tel.</emph></p>



<p>When the <ingredient>steak</ingredient> is cooked, it is placed on the hot



platter. First, then, <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and 



<ingredient>pepper</ingredient> are sprinkled over; then comes a sprinkling of



very finely chopped <ingredient>parsley;</ingredient> then some drops of 



<ingredient>lemon-juice;</ingredient> lastly, small pieces of 



<ingredient>butter</ingredient> are carefully spread over. Place the 



<ingredient>steak</ingredient> into the oven for a few moments until the 



<ingredient>butter</ingredient> is well melted and soaked into the 



<ingredient>steak.</ingredient></p>



<p>For extra-company breakfasts, only the fillets,

<ingredient>porter-house or tenderloin steaks,</ingredient> are used. They are



cut into little even shapes, round or oval, one for each plate. They are

<recipe class1="meatfishgame">



<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">ROAST TURKEY.</purpose>The



secret in having a good roast <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> is to baste it



often, and to cook it long enough. A small <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> of



seven or eight pounds (the best selection if fat) should be roasted or baked



three hours at least. A very large <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> should not



be cooked a minute less than four hours; an extra hour is preferable to a



minute less. If properly basted, they will not become dry.</p>



<p>With much experience in hotel life, where 



<ingredient>turkeys</ingredient>are ruined by the wholesale, I have never seen



a piece of <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> that was fit to eat. Besides being



tasteless, they are almost invariably undercooked. First, then, after the 



<ingredient>turkey</ingredient> is dressed, season it well, sprinkling 



<ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> on the



inside; stuff it, and tie it well in shape; either lard the top or lay slices



of <ingredient>bacon</ingredient> over it; wet the skin, and sprinkle it well



with <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and 



<ingredient>flour.</ingredient> It is well to allow a 



<ingredient>turkey</ingredient> to remain some time stuffed before cooking.



Pour a little <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> into the bottom of the 



<implement>dripping-pan.</implement> If it is to be roasted, do not put it too



near the coals at first, until it gets well heated through; then gradually draw



it nearer. The excellence of the <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> depends much



upon the frequency of basting it; occasionally baste it with a little 



<ingredient>butter,</ingredient> oftener with its own 



<ingredient>drippings.</ingredient> Just before taking it from the fire or out



of the oven, put on more <ingredient>melted butter,</ingredient> and sprinkle



over more <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> this will make the skin more crisp



<pb n="167" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=173"/> and brown. While the 



<ingredient>turkey</ingredient> is cooking, boil the 



<ingredient>giblets</ingredient> well; chop them fine, and mash the 



<ingredient>liver.</ingredient> When the <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> is



done, put it on a hot platter. Put the <implement>baking-pan</implement> on the



fire, dredge in a little <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and when cooked stir



in a little <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> or 



<ingredient>stock;</ingredient> strain it, skim off every particle of fat; add



the <ingredient>giblets;</ingredient> season with

add<illustration><description>A whole roast turkey served on a round

<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy">



<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">PLAIN OMELET.</purpose>The fire



should be quite hot. All cookery-books especially expatiate on the necessity of



a pan to be used omelets alone.</p><pb n="215" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=221"/>



<p>Any clean, smooth iron <implement>spider,</implement> or <implement><emph

<implement>omelet-pan.</implement> Put the pan on the fire to become heated;



break the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> into a kitchen basin; sprinkle over



them <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and



give them twelve vigorous beats with a spoon. This is enough to break all the 



<ingredient>yolks,</ingredient> and twelve beats was Mr. Riddle's rule. Now put



<ingredient>butter</ingredient> the size of an egg (for five 



<ingredient>eggs</ingredient>) in the heated pan; turn it around so that it



will moisten all the bottom of the pan. When it is well melted, and 



<emph rend="italic">begins to boil,</emph> pour in the 



<ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> Holding the handle of the 



<implement>omelet-pan</implement> in the left hand, carefully and lightly with



a spoon draw up the whitened <ingredient>egg</ingredient> from the bottom, so



that all the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> may be equally cooked, or whitened



to a soft, creamy substance. Now, still with the left hand, shake the pan



forward and backward, which will disengage the 



<ingredient>eggs</ingredient>from the bottom; then shaking again the omelet a



little one side, turn with a spoon half of one side over the other; and



allowing it to remain it all the time, toss it over the other; and allowing it



to remain a moment to harden a little at the bottom, gently shaking it all the



time, toss it over on to a warm platter held in the right hand. A little



practice makes one quite dexterous in placing the omelet in the centre of the



platter, and turning it over as it is tossed from the 



<implement>omelet-pan.</implement></p>



<p>However, if one is unsuccessful in the tossing operation, which is the



correct thing, according to the cooking professor, the omelet can be lifted to



the platter with a <implement>pancake-turner.</implement> It should be creamy



and light in the centre, and more firm on the outside.</p>



<p>I will specify several different omelets. A variety of others may be made in







the same way, by adding boiled <ingredient>tongue</ingredient> cut into dice,



sliced <ingredient>truffles,</ingredient> cooked and sliced

vinegar,</ingredient> 



<emph rend="italic">i.e.,</emph> <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> in which 



<ingredient>tarragon</ingredient> has been soaked.</p>



<p>Pour the <ingredient>oil,</ingredient> mixed with the 



<ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> over the



salad; mix them together; then add the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> and mix



again. <attribution>Chaptal</attribution> says: "It results, from this process,



that there can never be too much <ingredient>vinegar:</ingredient> from the



specific gravity of the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> compared with the 



<ingredient>oil,</ingredient> what is more than needful will fall to the bottom



of the salad-bowl. The <ingredient>salt</ingredient> should not be dissolved in



the <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> but in the 



<ingredient>oil,</ingredient>by which means it is more equally distributed



through the salad."</p>



<p>This is the usual mode of mixing the salad; but I prefer to mix the 



<ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> then add the



<ingredient>oil</ingredient> and <ingredient>onion,</ingredient> and then the 



<ingredient>vinegar;</ingredient> and, when well mingled, to pour the mixture



over the salad, or place the salad over it, and mix all together. It seems to



me to be more evenly distributed in this manner.</p>



<p>Many different combinations can be made to suit the fancy, from the list of



salad materials. I will give certain combinations oftenest seen. It must be



remembered that salad is never good unless perfectly fresh. It should not be



mixed, or brought into the dining-room, until the moment when it is to be



eaten.</p>



<p>When preparing <ingredient>lettuce</ingredient> salad, choose the crisp,



tender, centre leaves of <ingredient>head lettuce.</ingredient> The kind seen



in England and France,<pb n="223" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=229"/> called 



<ingredient rend="italic">romaine,</ingredient> is now much used in New York;



it is very crisp and tender. The seeds of this 



<ingredient>lettuce</ingredient>can be obtained in New York. In the East, 



<ingredient>tarragon,</ingredient>and <ingredient>endive</ingredient> also, are



largely produced, and used to imitate these foreign salads. The 



<ingredient>tarragon leaves</ingredient> are chopped fine, and mixed in the 



<ingredient>French dressing (without onion)</ingredient> to use with 



<ingredient>lettuce.</ingredient> The taste for



<ingredient>tarragon</ingredient> is generally an acquired one: I prefer the 



<ingredient>tarragon vinegar</ingredient> to the fresh leaves, as it has only a



slight flavor of the plant.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">PUFF



PASTE.</purpose>Ingredients: One pound of 



<ingredient>flour,</ingredient>three-quarters of a pound of 



<ingredient>butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>yolks of two eggs,</ingredient> a



little <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> a sprinkle of



<ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> a little very cold (or, better, ice-cold) 



<ingredient>water.</ingredient> (All the professional cooks use a pound of 



<ingredient>butter</ingredient> to a pound of <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> I



think it makes the pastry too rich, and prefer three quarters of a pound of 



<ingredient>butter</ingredient> to a pound of 



<ingredient>flour.</ingredient>)</p>



<p>Sift and weigh the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and put it on the board



or marble slab; sprinkle a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and a very



little <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> over it. Beat the <ingredient>yolks of



the eggs,</ingredient> and then stir into them a few spoonfuls of 



<ingredient>ice-cold water;</ingredient> pour this slowly into the centre of



the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> with the left hand, working it at the same



time well into the mass with the tips of the fingers of the right hand.



Continue to work it, turning the fingers round and round on the board, until



you have a well-worked, smooth, and firm <ingredient>paste.</ingredient> Now



roll it out into a rectangular form, being particular to have the edges quite



straight. Much of success depends upon the even folding of the paste. Work the 



<ingredient>butter</ingredient> (which should be kept some minutes in very 



<ingredient>cold water</ingredient> if it is at all soft) until the moisture



and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> are wiped out, and it is quite supple; care



must be taken, however, to keep the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> from



getting too soft, as in this condition it would ruin the paste. Divide it into



three equal parts; spread one part as flatly and evenly as possible over half



of the crust, turn the other half over it, folding it a second time from right



to left. Roll this out to the same rectangular form as before; spread the



second portion of the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> on half of the crust;



fold and roll it out again as before, repeating the same process with the third



portion of <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> The paste has now been given what



they call three turns; it should be given six turns, turning and rolling the



paste after the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is in. However, after the first



three turns, or after the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is all in, the paste



should be placed on the <ingredient>ice,</ingredient> or in a cold place, to



remain about ten or fifteen minutes between each of the last three turns: this



will prevent the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> getting soft enough to



penetrate the dough. Each time before the dough is folded, it should be turned



half round, so as to roll it in a different direction each time; this makes the



layers<pb n="234" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=240"/> more even. In order to turn the paste, the



end may be held to the rolling-pin; then, rolling the pin, the dough will fold



loosely around it; the board may be sprinkled with 



<ingredient>flour;</ingredient> then the dough can be unrolled in the side



direction. This is better than to turn it with the hands, as it should be



handled as little as possible. When folded the last time, put the paste on a



platter, cover, and place in on the ice for half an hour, or where it may



become thoroughly chilled; then roll it out for immediate use; or, so long as



it is kept in a half-frozen state, it may be kept for one or two days. Firm,



solid <ingredient>butter</ingredient> should be selected for puff paste; a



light, crumbling <ingredient>butter</ingredient> would be very unsuitable.



After the pies, patties, or other articles are made (as in receipts), the



scraps may be used for making 



<emph rend="italic">rissoles.</emph> Always select the coolest place possible



for making <ingredient>puff paste.</ingredient> In winter it is well to make it



by an open window.</p>

<recipe class1="breadsweets">



<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">CAR&#234;ME'S RECEIPT FOR PUFF



PASTE.</purpose>Ingredients: Twelve ounces of fine sifted 



<ingredient>flour,</ingredient> twelve ounces of 



<ingredient>butter,</ingredient> two drams of <ingredient>fine



salt,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>yolks of two



eggs</ingredient>beaten.</p>



<p>Manner of working: Having placed twelve ounces of 



<ingredient>flour</ingredient> on the board, make a small hole in the middle,



into which put two drams of <ingredient>fine salt,</ingredient> the 



<ingredient>yolks of two eggs,</ingredient> and nearly a glass of 



<ingredient>water.</ingredient> With the ends of the fingers gradually mix the 



<ingredient>flour</ingredient> with the ingredients, adding a little 



<ingredient>water</ingredient> when necessary, till the paste is of a proper



consistence--rather firm than otherwise. Then lean your hand on the board, and



work it for some minutes, when the paste will become soft to the touch and



glossy in appearance.</p>



<p>Care must be taken, in mixing the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> with the



liquid ingredients, that they do not escape, and that the paste be very lightly



gathered together, to prevent it from forming into lumps, which render it



stiff, and very difficult to be worked, thereby in some degree causing a



failure, which is easily ascertained by the paste, when drawn out, immediately



receding, which arises from its having been clumsily and irregularly mixed. To



remedy this, let it be carefully rolled out, placing here and there five or six



pieces of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> each the size of a



<pb n="235" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=241"/> nutmeg, when, after working it as before, it



will acquire the degree of softness necessary. It is of importance to observe



that this paste should be neither too soft nor too hard, but of a proper



medium; yet it is better to be a little too soft than too stiff. One should not



choose a hot place in which to make paste: for this reason, summer renders the



operation quite difficult. If one can not find a cool place, the paste might be



slightly stiffer in summer than in winter.</p>



<p>When the paste has been made as above, take three-quarters of a pound of 



<ingredient>butter</ingredient> in pieces, which has been twenty minutes in 



<ingredient>ice-water,</ingredient> well washed and pounded. Squeeze and work



it well in a napkin, in order to separate the 



<ingredient>water</ingredient>from it, and at the same time to render it soft,



and, above all, of an equal consistence; then, as quickly as possible, roll the



paste into a square on a marble slab (the ends must be perfectly even, as much



success depends upon folding); place the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in the



middle; spread it over half the paste, immediately turning over the other half



of the paste to cover it. Then roll the paste out about three feet in length;



fold it into three parts by doubling one part over the other; after which roll



it out again, and fold it once more into three equal parts; now roll it to a



greater length, fold it, and put it quickly on a plate sprinkled with 



<ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Place this upon ten pounds of 



<ingredient>pounded ice,</ingredient> then, covering it with a second plate,



put upon that one pound of broken ice. This plate serves to keep the surface of



the paste cool, and also to prevent its becoming soft by the action of the air.



After two or three minutes, remove the plate, and turn the paste upside down,



instantly covering it as before. After about fifteen minutes, roll it out, and



use it as expeditiously as possible.</p>



<p>Thus, in less than half an hour, it is possible to make very fine 



<ingredient>puff paste,</ingredient> having previously every thing ready--the



ice pounded, the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> frozen, and the oven quite



hot; for otherwise it can not be done. This is all-important, as it is



sometimes an hour before the oven can be made hot. When the oven is half



heated, begin to make the paste.</p>



<p>The great variety of elegant and delicate forms<ref target="n6">*</ref> this



paste is<pb n="236" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=242"/> made to assume justifies one for giving



such explicit instructions, and repays one for all necessary pains to make



it.</p>

friend spoke to me so often about a wonderfully delicious pie that a lady



friend in the country made, that it is not surprising that a person of my



culinary tastes should have been very curious. "I will send for the receipt,"



said I. "But that will not benefit you," he replied, "for I have given the



receipt to several of my friends, and they never succeed. Instead of the light



production three or four inches high of my country friend, the others are



heavy, waxy affairs, very different." I actually took a little journey to see



the lady, to get any side explanations from her own lips. I was repaid, as you



will see by trying the pie.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO JELLY FRUITS.</purpose>To



make jelly clear, the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> must be quite fresh, and



all blemishes removed. Have the flannels used for straining perfectly clean and



white. Nearly all jellies are made in the same way, whether 



<ingredient>currant,</ingredient> <ingredient>plum,</ingredient> 



<ingredient>Siberian crab-apple,</ingredient> 



<ingredient>gooseberry,</ingredient> <ingredient>quince,</ingredient> 



<ingredient>apple,</ingredient> <ingredient>peach,</ingredient> or

the sweeter <ingredient>fruits.</ingredient> The first five 



<ingredient>fruits</ingredient> mentioned are exceedingly easy to jelly; the 



<ingredient>grape</ingredient> is often quite vexatious, with its perverse



inclinations. <ingredient>Cherries</ingredient> will not jelly without 



<ingredient>gelatine.</ingredient></p>



<p>After having freed the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> from all blemishes,



put them into a porcelain <implement>preserving-kettle,</implement> with only



enough clear <ingredient>water</ingredient> to keep them from burning at first.



Let them boil slowly until quite soft; then, putting them into a flannel cloth,



press from them all the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> possible. Strain the 



<ingredient>juice</ingredient> two or three times through a clean cloth; then



return it to the clean <implement>preserving-kettle,</implement> adding a cup



of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> for every cup of 



<ingredient>juice,</ingredient> and the beaten <ingredient>white of an



egg</ingredient> for the whole. The rule is to boil the sirup (without



stirring) very rapidly for twenty minutes, not counting the minutes until it



begins to boil. The safest rule is to boil it until it runs a little thick upon



the spoon; then let it run through the <implement>jelly-bag</implement> without



pressing it. If there is any fear of the jelly becoming too hard before it all



runs through, place it near the fire. The most convenient 



<implement>jelly-strainer</implement> is made by fastening the four corners of



a flannel cloth to a <implement>filter-stool</implement> (see page 57). If the



first dripping of the jelly is not entirely clear, return it to the strainer



until it runs perfectly limpid. Put the jelly into glasses; and, after it has



become quite firm, cut out little papers to fit the tops, which should be



dipped in brandy. Place over these second papers larger ones, which have been



dipped in the whites of eggs. Press the edges against the sides of the glasses,



to exclude the air.</p>

<p>"This receipt has three advantages: First, it never fails, as the old plan



is sure to do five times out of eight; secondly, it requires but half the usual



quantity of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and so retains the grateful acidity



and peculiar flavor of the <ingredient>fruit;</ingredient> thirdly, it is by



far less troublesome than the usual method. Weigh the 



<ingredient>currants</ingredient> without taking the trouble to remove the



stems; do not wash them, but carefully remove leaves and whatever may adhere to



them. To each pound of <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> allow half the weight of 



<ingredient>granulated or pure loaf sugar.</ingredient> Put a few 



<ingredient>currants</ingredient> into a porcelain-lined kettle, and press them



with a <implement>potato-masher,</implement> or any thing convenient, in order



to secure sufficient liquid to prevent burning; then add the remainder of the 



<ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> and boil freely for twenty minutes, stirring



occasionally to prevent burning. Take out and strain carefully through a



three-cornered bag of strong, close texture, putting the liquid into either



earthen or wooden vessels--never in tin, as the action of the acid on tin



materially affects both color and flavor. When strained, return the liquid to



the kettle, without the trouble of measuring, and let it boil thoroughly for a



moment or so, and then add the <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient> The moment the 



<ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is entirely dissolved, the jelly is done, and



must be immediately dished, or placed in glasses. It will jelly upon the side



of the cup as it is taken up, leaving no doubt as the result. Gather the 



<ingredient>fruit</ingredient> early, as soon as fully ripe, since the pulp



softens and the juice is less rich if allowed to remain long after ripening. In



our climate, the first week in July is usually considered the time to make



currant jelly. Never gather <ingredient>currants</ingredient> or other soft or



small seed fruit immediately after a rain for preserving purposes, as they are



greatly impoverished by the moisture absorbed. <variation><purpose><alt

<ingredient>butter</ingredient> them slightly; then dip them for a moment in a



pan containing enough <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> to half cover them;



they should be only slightly moistened. Now place each slice on a separate hot



plate, allowing one slice for each person at table; sprinkle over a little 



<ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and pour over them enough melted 



<ingredient>cheese</ingredient> to cover them. Select rich, new 



<ingredient>cheese,</ingredient> as it is more easily melted. It can be melted



in a little cup. It should not be made until almost ready to serve, as the



moment it is finished it should be eaten; otherwise the 



<ingredient>cheese</ingredient> will harden, the 



<ingredient>toast</ingredient>will become cold, and the dish altogether will be



quite ruined.</p>



<p>This is a favorite dish for gentlemen's suppers or for lunch; yet it is



sometimes served at dinner for a <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> course by



itself, or for decorating a platter of macaroni with cheese.</p>



<p>This simple receipt is decidedly the best one, I think; yet some spread also



a little <ingredient>mustard</ingredient> over the 



<ingredient>toast,</ingredient> and others add a little 



<ingredient>ale</ingredient> to the melted 



<ingredient>cheese.</ingredient>Sometimes the <ingredient>toast</ingredient>



may be dipped into <ingredient>ale</ingredient> instead of <ingredient>hot



water,</ingredient> and some serve a <ingredient>poached



<pb n="265" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=271"/> egg</ingredient>on each slice of Welsh rare-bit;



still others mix the <ingredient>yolks of eggs</ingredient> into the 



<ingredient>cheese</ingredient> when melted.</p>



<p>The Welsh rare-bit makes a decidedly pretty course, served in little 



<implement>chafing-dishes</implement> in silver, or plated silver, about four



inches square, one of which, standing in a plate, is to be served to each



person at table. The reservoir contains boiling-hot water; the little platter



holds the slice of Welsh rare-bit, which is thus kept hot.</p>

<p>The secret of making 



<emph rend="italic">m&#233;ringues</emph> is in the baking. Put them into a



moderate oven, and leave the oven-door open for thirty-five minutes at least.



They should not be allowed to color for that time, which would prevent them for



drying properly, and a thin paper crust is very undesirable for a 



<emph rend="italic">m&#233;ringue;</emph> in fact, the longer they dry before



coloring, the thicker will be the crust. They should be in the oven at least



three-quarters of an hour, only allowing them to color slightly the last two or



three minutes. While they are still hot, scoop out carefully the soft contents,



and when they are cold fill them with <ingredient>whipped



cream,</ingredient>press two of them together, forming a ball, and put them

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">FROSTING.</purpose>The old way



of making frosting was a half-day's work. I now laugh at the extra exertion



once made to be sure that the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> were sufficiently



and properly beaten. The following is the true way to make frosting, which is



done and dried on the cake in ten minutes, allowing three minutes for the



making:</p>



<p>Use a heaping tea-cupful of fine <ingredient>pulverized sugar</ingredient>to



the <ingredient>white of each egg,</ingredient> or, say, a pound of 



<ingredient>sugar</ingredient> to the <ingredient>whites of three



eggs.</ingredient> Beat the <ingredient>whites</ingredient> until they are



slightly 



<emph rend="italic">foaming</emph> only; do not beat them to a froth. The 



<ingredient>sugar</ingredient> may all be poured on the 



<ingredient>egg</ingredient> at once, or, if considered easier to mix, it may



be gradually added. Either way, as soon as the 



<ingredient>sugar</ingredient>and <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> are thoroughly



stirred together, and flavored with a little <ingredient>lemon</ingredient> or 



<ingredient>vanilla,</ingredient> the icing is ready to spread over the cake.



It would be advisable to ice the cakes as soon as they are taken from the oven.



The icing made with the <ingredient>white of one egg</ingredient> is quite



sufficient to frost an ordinary-sized cake.</p>



<p>It is very little extra trouble to decorate a frosted cake. One can purchase



funnels for the purpose with different shaped ends. In place of no better



funnel, make a cornucopia of stiff writing-paper; fill it with the frosting,



and press it out at the small end, forming different shapes, according to



taste, over the cake. Little centre-pieces or leaves can always be purchased at



the confectioner's to aid in the decoration.</p><pb n="305" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=311"/>



<p><variation>For a cocoa-nut cake, mix plenty of the grated 



<ingredient>cocoa-nut</ingredient> into the frosting, which spread over the



cake; decorate it then with <ingredient>plain



frosting.</ingredient></variation></p>



<p><variation>For a chocolate-cake, after spreading over the 



<ingredient>chocolate frosting</ingredient> mentioned in the receipt for



chocolate-cake, decorate it with delicate lines of the <ingredient>white



frosting.</ingredient></variation></p>



<p>The appearance of boiled icing (which is generally flavored with lemon) is



much improved also by a decoration with the plain white frosting.</p>

large, fresh, ripe, and juicy <ingredient>peaches;</ingredient> pare, and cut



them into two or three pieces. They should be large, luscious-looking pieces,



not little chipped affairs. Sprinkle over <ingredient>granulated



sugar,</ingredient> put them into the freezer, and half freeze them; this will



require about an hour, as they are more difficult to freeze than cream. Do not



take them from the freezer until the moment of serving, when sprinkle over a

<p>Ingredients: Four quarts of <ingredient>Jamaica rum,</ingredient> three



quarts of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> five pints of boiling 



<ingredient>milk,</ingredient> three pounds of 



<ingredient>loaf-sugar,</ingredient> twenty-four 



<ingredient>lemons,</ingredient> two <ingredient>nutmegs.</ingredient></p>



<p>Cut thin slices, or only the yellow part of the <ingredient>rinds of the



twenty-four lemons.</ingredient> Let these thin parings and the two grated



<pb n="340" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=346"/> <ingredient>nutmegs</ingredient> infuse for



twenty-four hours in one quart of the <ingredient>rum.</ingredient> It should



be put in a warm place.</p>



<p>At the end of the twenty-four hours, add to the <ingredient>juice of the



twenty-four lemons</ingredient> (freed from seeds) the 



<ingredient>water,</ingredient> <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> 



<ingredient>rum,</ingredient> and also the 



<ingredient>rum</ingredient>containing the <ingredient>lemon-peel</ingredient>



and <ingredient>nutmeg.</ingredient> Put all into a large vessel. When the 



<ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is dissolved, add the five pints of boiling 



<ingredient>milk</ingredient> while the mixture is being stirred all the time.



It will curdle, of course. Then cover it, and let it stand still one hour, when



filter it through a bag, until it is as clear and bright as a crystal. It may



take three or four hours. Pale <ingredient>rum</ingredient> should be used.



This quantity will make enough to fill about one dozen quart bottles. Cork them



well, and keep them standing. It may be used at once, but it will not be in



perfection until it is a year or two old. It will keep forever. The bag may be



made three-cornered with a yard square of rather coarse Canton flannel.</p>



<p>This punch is nice to serve with mock-turtle soup, or it may be used for



making Roman punch. Like sherry, it is a convenient beverage to offer, with



cake, to a lady friend at any time.</p>
