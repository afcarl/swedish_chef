<p><purpose rend="italic">Clarification of Raw Sugar.</purpose>







--For every six pounds of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> required to be clarified, take one quart of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> the <ingredient>white of an egg,</ingredient> and about half a teacupful of <ingredient>bullock's blood.</ingredient> Less than a pint will be sufficient for 112 pounds; but if a very fine, transparent, and colourless syrup is required, use either <ingredient>charcoal,</ingredient> finely powdered, or <ingredient>ivory black,</ingredient> instead of the blood. Put the <ingredient>white of the egg</ingredient> in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and whisk it to a froth, then add either of the other articles mentioned, and the <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> place the pan containing the ingredients on the stove-fire, and stir them well with a <implement>spatula,</implement> until the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is dissolved, and is nearly boiling. When the ebullition commences, throw in a little <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> to check it; this causes the coarser parts to separate more freely, by which means the whole of the impurities attach themselves to the clarifying matter used; continue this for about five minutes, using about one pint of <ingredient>water</ingredient> to every six pounds of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> or more, until you consider the whole of the dross is discharged, and there remains a fine clear syrup. Then place it by the side of the stove, and carefully remove with a <implement>skimmer</implement> the scum which has formed on the top: it may also be taken off as it rises, but I find the best method is to let it remain a short time after it is clarified before it is removed, otherwise, if you take it off as it rises, part of the syrup is also taken with it. When either <ingredient>charcoal</ingredient> or black is used, it must be passed through a <implement>filtering-bag</implement> made of thick flannel, in the shape of a cone, having a hoop fastened round the top to keep it extended, and to which strings are sewn that it may be tied or suspended in any convenient manner: what runs out at first will be

quite black; return this again into the bag, and continue doing so until it runs fine and clear.</p>



<p><variation>If a little <ingredient>lime,</ingredient> about a spoonful, or any other <ingredient>alkali</ingredient> is added to the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> with the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> &amp;c., it will neutralize the acid which all raw <ingredient>sugars</ingredient> contain, and they will be found to stand much better after they have been manufactured, by not taking the damp so soon. This is not generally done by the trade, but it will be found beneficial if practised.</variation></p>

<p><purpose rend="italic">To clarify Loaf Sugar.</purpose>







--This is clarified by mixing the <ingredient>whites of eggs</ingredient> with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> without any other assistance, for having been previously refined, it does not require those auxiliaries again to separate the coarser parts, unless it is of an inferior quality, or an extra fine syrup, as for bon-bons and other fancy articles, is required. <variation>When it is necessary to have a very fine sparkling grain, in that case break your lump into small pieces and put it in a <implement>preserving-pan,</implement> with a sufficient quantity of <ingredient>water</ingredient> to dissolve it, in which has been mixed the <ingredient>white of an egg</ingredient> and <ingredient>powdered charcoal,</ingredient><ref target="n1" height="superscript">*</ref> as for raw sugar, following those instructions already given.

<p>The scum should always be reserved, when <ingredient>charcoal</ingredient> or black is not used, to mix with the articles of inferior quality.</p>



<p>The best refined loaf sugar should be white, dry, fine, of a brilliant sparkling appearance when broken, and as close in texture as possible. The best sort of brown has a bright, sparkling, and gravelly look. East India sugars appear finer, but to not contain so much saccharine matter, yet they are much used for manufacturing the best sort of common sweetmeats, when clarified, instead of <ingredient>loaf sugar.</ingredient></p>

<recipe class1="accompaniments">



<p>The nature and principle of this operation are these. First, as in the case of syrup (the first four degrees), <emph rend="italic">when the <ingredient>water</ingredient> has absorbed as much <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> as it is capable of containing in a cold state,</emph> by continuing the boiling, a further portion of the solvent (<ingredient>water</ingredient>) is evaporated, and <purpose><alt synonym1="to crystallize sugar">sugar</alt></purpose>







remains in excess, which, when exposed to a less degree of heat, separates itself, and forms crystals on the surface and sides of the vessel in which it is contained, and also on anything placed or suspended in it. But if it is exposed too suddenly to the cold, or disturbed in its action by being shaken, or if the boiling has been continued too long, the crystals will form irregularly by the particles being brought in too close contact, and run too hastily together, forming a mass or lump.</p>



<p>To obtain this part in perfection, the boiling should be gradual, and continued no longer than till a few drops let fall on a cold surface show a crystalline appearance, or after being removed from the fire a <emph rend="italic">thin</emph> skin will form on the surface. It should then be taken from the fire and placed in <emph rend="italic">a less hot but not cold</emph> place, and covered or put into a stove or <implement>hot closet</implement> to prevent the access of cold air. A few drops of <ingredient>spirits of wine,</ingredient> added when the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> has attained the proper degree, will conduce to a more perfect crystalline form, scarcely attainable by any other means, as it has a great affinity with the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> thereby causing the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> to separate itself more freely. It must be used with caution, as too much will cause it to grain.</p>

<recipe class1="accompaniments">



<p><purpose rend="italic">The Crack.</purpose>







--Follow the directions given for the ball. Slip the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> off from the stick, still holding it in the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> then press it between the finger and thumb; if it breaks short and crisp, with a slight noise, it is at the crack.</p>

--To obtain this degree it requires care and attention, and also to be frequently tried, as it passes speedily from the crack to the caramel. Try it as before directed, and let the <ingredient>water</ingredient> be quite cold, or you will be deceived. If on taking it off the stick it snaps like glass, with a loud noise, it has attained the proper degree; it will also, when it arrives at this point, assume a beautiful yellow colour; after this it will speedily burn, taking all the hues from a brown to a black; therefore, to prevent this, dip the bottom of the pan into a pail of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> as soon as it comes to caramel, as the heat which is contained in the pan and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is sufficient to advance it one degree; also be careful that the flame of the fire does not ascend round the sides of the pan, which will burn it.</p>

About as much <ingredient>cream of tartar</ingredient> as may be laid on a sixpence, and added to seven pounds of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> with the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> or equal quantities of <ingredient>cream of tartar</ingredient> and <ingredient>alum</ingredient> in powder, added when

<pb n="19" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=19"/>







of ebullition. In selecting and conducting the operation, the following general rules should be observed:--</p>



<p>"1st. Infusion should always be preferred before decoction, where the virtues of the vegetable substance reside in volatile oil, or in principles which are easily soluble; whereas, if they depend upon resino-mucilaginous particles, decoction is an indispensible operation.</p>



<p>"2nd. The temperature employed must be varied according to the circumstances of each case, and infusion made with cold is in general more grateful but less active than one made with heat.</p>



<p>"3rd. The duration of the process must likewise be regulated by the nature of the substances; for the infusion will differ according to the time in which the <ingredient>water</ingredient> has been digested on the materials; thus the aroma of the <ingredient>plant</ingredient> is first taken up, then in succession the colouring, astringent, and gummy parts.</p>

<recipe class1="accompaniments">



<p><purpose rend="italic">Decoctions.</purpose>







--"These are solutions of the active principles of <ingredient>vegetables,</ingredient> obtained by boiling them in <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p>



<p>"1st. Those principles only should be decocted whose virtues reside in principles which are soluble in <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p>



<p>"2nd. If the active principle be volatile, decoction must be an injurious process; and if it consists of extractive matter, long boiling, by favouring its oxidizement, will render it insipid, insoluble, and inert.</p>



<p>"3rd. The substances to be decocted should be previously bruised or sliced, so as to expose an extended surface to the action of the <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p>



<p>"4th. The substances should be completely covered with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and the vessel slightly closed, in order to prevent as much as possible the access of air; the boiling should be continued without interruption, and gently.</p>



<p>"5th. In compound decoctions, it is sometimes convenient not to put in all the ingredients from the beginning, but in succession, according to their hardness, and the difficulty with which their virtues are extracted; and if any aromatic or other substances containing volatile principles, or oxidizable matter, enter into the composition, the boiling decoction should be simply poured upon them, and covered up until cold.</p>



<p>"6th. The relative proportions of different vegetable substances to the <ingredient>water</ingredient> must be regulated by their nature. The following general rule may be admitted. Of <ingredient>roots,</ingredient> <ingredient>barks,</ingredient> or <ingredient>dried woods,</ingredient> from two drachms to six to every pint of <ingredient>water:</ingredient> of <ingredient>herbs,</ingredient> or <ingredient>flowers,</ingredient> half that quantity will suffice.</p>



<p>"7th. The decoction ought to be filtered through linen while hot, as important portions of the dissolved matter are frequently deposited on cooling; care must also be taken that the filter is not too fine, for it frequently happens that the virtues of a decoction depend upon the presence of particles in a minutely divided state."--<attribution rend="italic">Paris's Pharmacologia.</attribution></p>

--An iron <implement>pestle</implement> and <implement>mortar</implement> is requisite for this purpose, also a stone of the closest grain and texture which can be procured, and a rolling-pin made of the same material, or of iron. The stone must be fixed in such a manner that it may be heated from below with a pot of burning charcoal, or something similar.</p>



<p>Warm the <implement>mortar</implement> and <implement>pestle</implement> by placing them on a stove, or by means of charcoal, until they are so hot that you can scarcely bear your hand against them. Wipe the <implement>mortar</implement> out clean, and put any convenient quantity of your prepared <ingredient>nuts</ingredient> in it, which you pound until they are reduced to an oily paste into which the <implement>pestle</implement> will sink by its own weight. If it is required sweet, add about one-half, or two-thirds of its weight of <ingredient>loaf sugar</ingredient> in powder; again pound it so as to mix it well together, then put it in a pan, and place it in the stove to keep warm. Take a portion of it and roll or grind it well on the slab with the roller (both being previously heated like the <implement>mortar</implement>) until it is reduced to a smooth impalpable paste, which will melt in the mouth like butter. When this is accomplished, put it in another pan, and keep it warm until the whole is similarly disposed of; then place it again on the stone, which must not be quite so warm as previously, work it over again, and divide it into pieces of two, four, eight, or sixteen ounces each, which you put in moulds. Give it a shake, and the chocolate will become flat. When cold it will easily turn out.</p>



<p>The moulds for chocolate may either be made of tin or copper, and of different devices, such as men, animals, fish, culinary or other utensils, &amp;c.; also some square ones for half-pound cakes, having divisions on the bottom which are <alt synonym1="relieved.">relievoed.</alt> These cause the hollow impressions on the cakes.</p>



<p>The Bayonne or Spanish chocolate is in general the most esteemed. The reason of its superior quality is attributed by some to the hardness of the Pyrenean stone which they employ in making it, which does not absorb the oil from the <ingredient>nuts.</ingredient> They do not use any <implement>pestle</implement> and <implement>mortar,</implement> but levigate their <ingredient>nuts</ingredient> on the stone, which is fixed on a slope; and in the second pounding or rolling the paste is pressed closely on the stone, so as to extract the oil, which runs into a pan containing the quantity of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> intended to be used, and is placed underneath to receive it; the <ingredient>oil of the cacao</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> are then well mixed together with a <implement>spatula,</implement> again mixed with the paste on the stone, and finished.</p>

<p><purpose rend="italic">Scotch Caraway Comfits.</purpose>







--Sift two pounds of <ingredient>seeds</ingredient> in a <implement>hair sieve</implement> to free them from dust, put them into the <implement>comfit-pan,</implement> and rub them well about the bottom with your hand until they are quite warm; have some <ingredient>clarified loaf sugar in syrup</ingredient> and boiled to the small thread; give them a charge by pouring over them about two table-spoonfuls to commence with; rub and shake them well about the pan, that they may take the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> equally, until they are quite dry. Be careful in not making them too wet in the first charges by using too much <ingredient>syrup,</ingredient> or they will lie of a lump and get doubled, and you will have difficulty in parting them. It will prevent their sticking together if the hand is passed through them between every swing of the pan, and also add to their smoothness. Do not let the heat under the pan be too strong, or it will spoil their whiteness. Give them four or five charges, increasing the quantity of <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> a little each time, and let each charge be well dried before another is given, dusting them at the last charge with <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Sift them in a <implement>hair sieve,</implement> and clean the pan. Put them in again, and give them four or five charges more, with a dust of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> at the last; then sift them and clean the pan. Proceed in this manner until they are one-third of the required size. Put them into the stove or sun to dry until the next day, then clarify and boil some <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> to the large thread, keep it warm as before, divide the comfits, and put part of them in the pan, so as not to have too many at one time, for as they increase in size you must divide them into convenient portions, so that you may be enabled to work them properly without encumbering the pan. Give them four or five charges of <ingredient>syrup,</ingredient> proceeding in the same manner as before, until they

On the third day, boil the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> to the small pearl, and give eight or ten charges as before, without using <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> so as to finish them, lessening the quantity of <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> each time. Swing the pan gently, and dry each charge well. Put them in the stove for half an hour or an hour after each charge, and proceed alternately with each portion until they are finished, when they should be about the size of peas. Put them in the stove for a day, then smooth them with the whitest <ingredient>loaf sugar in syrup,</ingredient> boiled to the small thread; add two or three table-spoonfuls of dissolved <ingredient>gum Arabic</ingredient> with it to give them a gloss. Give three or four charges with a very gentle heat, the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> being cold and the pan scarcely warm. Work and dry each charge well before another is added: when finished, dry them in a moderate heat. It is the best way, if possible, to dry comfits in the sun, as it bleaches them. If the stove is at a greater heat than the sun in a moderately warm day, which is from 70 to 80 degrees of Fahrenheit, it will spoil their whiteness.</p>

<p><purpose rend="italic">Cinnamon Comfits.</purpose>







--<ingredient>Cinnamon</ingredient> is the bark of a tree, of which there are two sorts. The inferior quality is that usually sold for <ingredient>cinnamon,</ingredient> and is otherwise known as cassia, or <emph rend="italic">cassia lignea.</emph> This breaks short, and has a slimy mucilaginous taste, is thicker, and of a darker colour than the <ingredient>cinnamon,</ingredient> which is the inner bark. This breaks shivery, and has a warm aromatic taste, and is of a reddish colour.</p>



<p>Take one pound of <ingredient>cinnamon bark,</ingredient> and steep it in <ingredient>water</ingredient> for a few hours to soften it; cut it into small pieces about half an inch long, and the size of a large needle. Dry it in the stove. Put your pieces, when dry, into the <implement>comfit-pan,</implement> and pour on them a little <ingredient>syrup,</ingredient> as for Scotch caraways, proceeding in the same way until they are one-third the required size. You must not use your hand for these as you would for caraways, as they are liable to break in two. Dry them in the stove, then suspend the <implement>pearling pot or cot</implement> from the bar of the pan or ceiling, so as to hang over the centre of the pan; boil some <ingredient>clarified loaf sugar</ingredient> to the large pearl, and fill the cot; put some of the prepared comfits in the pan, but not too many at a time, as it

is difficult to get them to pearl alike. Keep the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> at the boiling point: open the spigot of the <implement>cot</implement> so as to allow it to run in a very small stream, or more like a continued dropping; swing the pan backwards and forwards gently, and keep a stronger fire under the pan than otherwise. Be careful that the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> does not run too fast, and wet them too much, but so that it dries as soon as dropped, which causes them to appear rough. If one cot full of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is not enough, put in more until they are the required size. When one lot is finished put in sieves to dry, and proceed to another; but do not let them lie in the pan after you have finished shaking them. They will be whiter and better if partly pearled one day and finished the next. Use the best <ingredient>clarified sugar</ingredient> to finish them.</p>

<p>This method is much superior to that of preparing them with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> which renders the fruit flat, dead, and insipid, the whole of the flavour of the fruit being imparted to the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> except when bottled very green, when it does not lose it so much.</p>



<p><variation>A method I have tried with pretty good success, is to obtain the fruit before it is ripe, bottle it, and fill the bottles with <ingredient>cold spring water,</ingredient> in which are dissolved some <ingredient>oxymuriate of <alt synonym1="potash,">potass,</alt></ingredient> cork them close, and cover the mouths with rosin. <ingredient>Plums</ingredient> done in this way had the natural bloom on them. I found these were better than those done in a similar manner by heat. A few bottles of them fermented. After the fermentation was over I corked them close, and in six months I opened some, when they had a smell like wine, and were not so flat as those which were well preserved by heat, and filled with <ingredient>water;</ingredient> these certainly look well to the eye, but they are only fit to be used for large pies, when the <ingredient>water</ingredient> should be made into a syrup with <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and put in with it.</variation></p>



<p>The first method, which is the same as Appert's, or nearly so, is decidedly the best; it retains the natural flavour, and may be used for any purpose it is required, it being as good as fresh fruit.</p>

<p>This method of <attribution>M. Appert's</attribution> is not altogether original, but was anticipated by the experiments of Mr. Boyle.

<p><purpose rend="italic">To freeze Ices.</purpose>







--This is accomplished through the medium of <ingredient>ice.</ingredient> Of itself it does not contain sufficient frigorific power to congeal a liquid body to the required consistence without an auxiliary; the usual one employed is that of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> As a general rule, take about two pounds to every six pounds of ice, which I think will be nearly the quantity required. I cannot state precisely, as it is the custom to mix it by guess; but note, the freezing quality depends on the 



 



<pb n="71" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=71"/>







quantity of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> which is used, consequently, the more there is mixed with the ice the quicker are the creams, &amp;c., frozen.</p>



<p>Pound a sufficient quantity of ice small, and let some <ingredient>salt</ingredient> be well mixed with it; place the pot containing the mixture in a pail, which you fill (the latter) with pounded ice and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> as far as the lid; strew a handful of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> on the top of the ice, let it remain a few minutes until you have similarly disposed of others, as three or four may be done at a time if required, then whirl them round briskly by means of the handles for five minutes, take off the lids one at a time, and with the <implement>spatula</implement> stir or carry the unfrozen part well round the sides, turning the pot also with the left hand; continue this for two or three minutes, which serves to soften what has already frozen, as well as helps to freeze the remaining portion; then scrape it from the sides, put on the lids, whirl round again briskly, as before directed, repeating the same operations every four or five minutes. As it forms into consistence, do not spare your labour in well working or mixing it together when you scrape it down, so as to make it perfectly smooth and free from lumps, for the smoothness of your ice depends on this operation; continue to freeze until the whole is well set. Ice when well frozen should be about the consistence of butter, tough to the feel, of a good colour, and without any lumps in it. Those which contain too much <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> cannot be frozen to the degree required, and those which have too little freeze hard, and feel short and crisp, like compressed or frozen snow, which arises from having too many watery particles in it, by the excess of either <ingredient>water</ingredient> or <ingredient>milk</ingredient> according to the nature of your ice. In either case it may be ascertained when you commence freezing, by the first coat which is formed round the sides. It should then be altered by either adding more <ingredient>cream</ingredient> or <ingredient>water,</ingredient> with <ingredient>juice, or pulp of fruit,</ingredient> or other <ingredient>flavouring matter</ingredient> in proportion, as the case may be, if too rich, and <emph rend="italic">vice vers&#226;,</emph> by the addition of more syrup, &amp;c., when poor; but at all times the necessity of altering them should be avoided, as the component parts cannot be so perfectly blended together, without considerable extra labour, as if they were properly mixed at the commencement.</p>



<p>During the time of freezing, or after the creams, &amp;c., are moulded and set up, if there is too much <ingredient>water</ingredient> in the pail, the frigorific power is lessened; a little increases it, as at first it is only a solution of the <ingredient>salt;</ingredient> but as the ice dissolves and mixes with it, it decreases; therefore, when it comes to the top drain it off, and fill up with fresh <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and ice.</p>



<p>When the ices are properly frozen, take out the pots, drain off the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> empty the pail, again replace them and fill them with fresh <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and ice, as before; then spread the creams over the sides of the pot, when they are ready for use, if they are intended to be served in a shop or by glassfulls. Should it be required for moulds, line the bottom with a piece of paper, before you put it on; if there is no impression or figure on the top, you may cover that also with paper; in filling them press it well in, so as to fill every part; leave a little projecting 



 



<pb n="72" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=72"/>







above the surface to form the top, which you put on; pack the moulds in a pail, and fill the vacancies with pounded ice well mixed with plenty of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> strew a handful also on the top.</p>



<p>Ices should be moulded from half an hour to an hour before they are required to be served.</p>



<p>When you want to turn them out, wash the mould well in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> that no <ingredient>salt</ingredient> may remain on it; take off the bottom and top, and the ice will come out easily.</p>



<p><variation>For <purpose>fruit moulds,</purpose>







fill each with either <ingredient>cream or water ice</ingredient> of the same kind as that which you would represent, and for the better resemblance to nature, preserve the stone with the stalk and leaves of each, which put in their proper places, allowing the leaves to project outside; close the mould, wrap it in paper, and place it in <ingredient>ice</ingredient> as others; when you want to turn them out, wash the shape in <ingredient>lukewarm water</ingredient> to take off the paper, and be careful that you do not injure the leaves, as they will often be found frozen to it; dip it again in <ingredient>water,</ingredient> open it and take out the ice, which you colour to nature with <implement>camel's-hair pencils</implement> and <ingredient>liquid colour</ingredient> (see Colours); the down or bloom is represented by dusting it with <ingredient>dry colour</ingredient> in powder, tied in a small thin muslin bag, or by means of a dry <implement>camel's-hair pencil;</implement> line the shelves of the case with paper or vine leaves, and put in the fruit as it is finished; let the case be surrounded with <ingredient>pounded ice</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> as for moulds.</variation></p>

Many prefer the <ingredient>pyroligneous acid</ingredient> to the <ingredient>lemon-juice,</ingredient> but the flavour is not so delicate, and it always retains a smell of the acid; neither did I ever find, as some assert, that it improves the quality and appearance of the icing; the only advantage derived from it is that of economy.</p>

<p><purpose rend="italic"><alt synonym1="cake decoration">On piping Cakes, Bon-bons, &amp;c.</alt></purpose>







--This is a method of ornamenting wedding, twelfth-cakes, and other articles with icing, by means of small pipes or tubes; these are most generally made with writing-paper folded in the form of a cone, in the same manner as a grocer makes up his papers for small lots of sugar, tea, &amp;c. The tube is filled with <ingredient>icing,</ingredient> made as for cakes, the base of the cone, or the place where it was filled, is turned down to prevent the sides opening, and the escape of the icing; the point is then cut off with a sharp knife or scissors, so as to make a hole sufficiently large to form the icing, when squeezed or pressed out, in a thread of the required size, and which will either be fine or coarse according to the length of the point which is cut off. If the hole at the point of the cone is not perfectly straight when the icing is pressed out, it will form a spiral thread, which is very inconvenient to work with. Stars, borders, flowers, and different devices, are formed on cakes after they are iced, the execution of which depends on the ability and ingenuity of the artist. Baskets, Chinese and other temples, &amp;c., are formed on moulds by these means, first giving them a coating of <ingredient>white wax,</ingredient> which is brushed over them after it is melted, and when cold, the icing is formed on it like trellis-work; when finished, the mould is warmed, and the icing easily comes off. Some of the pipes which are used cannot be formed with paper, as the tape and star-pipes, which are made of tin, having a bag fastened to them in a similar manner to that generally used for dropping out Savoy biscuits, macaroons, &amp;c., only much smaller, the point of the tin tube of the one being fluted to form a star, and in the other it is flat, so that when the icing is forced or squeezed through, it comes out in a broad thin sheet, like a piece of tape. I employ a set of pipes made of tin, with small bags fastened to them; these are of different dimensions; the orifice of the round ones commences at the size of a common pin, and the tape pipes from

a quarter to half an inch in width. I find these much better than paper ones, as the trouble and time which is lost in constantly making new ones is amply repaid by the others, as they are not very expensive and are always ready for use. These pipes should be in the hands of the confectioner what the pencil or brush is to the painter,--capable of performing wonders with men of genius. Some of the bon-bons, which may be seen in the shops, are proofs of what I assert; and many things are so cleverly done, that many persons would believe that they were either formed in a mould or modelled. I have not space to enlarge further on this subject, but much more might be given in explanation; therefore the artist must be guided by his own genius and fancy.<ref target="n6" height="superscript">*</ref></p>

<p><emph rend="italic">Cakes.</emph>--<purpose>Rich pound-cake; twelfth, or bride-cakes:</purpose>







<ingredient>butter</ingredient> two pounds twelve ounces, <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> one pound twelve ounces, <ingredient>currants</ingredient> five pounds, <ingredient>citron</ingredient> one pound and a-half, <ingredient>almonds</ingredient> six ounces, <ingredient>nutmegs,</ingredient> <ingredient>mace,</ingredient> and <ingredient>cinnamon,</ingredient> of equal parts, in powder, two ounces; <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> twenty, <ingredient>brandy</ingredient> half a pint--these proportions allow for the cake being iced. If more <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is preferred, the quantity must be the same as the <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> but less is used in this instance, that the cake may be light, and also to allow for the fruit, which would make it too sweet. Double the quantity of <ingredient>almonds</ingredient> may be used if required, as some persons prefer more.</p>



<p>Warm a smooth pan, large enough for the mixture; put in the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and reduce it to a fine cream, by working it about the pan with your hand. In summer the pan need not be warmed, as it can be reduced to a cream without; but in the winter keep the mixture as warm as possible, without oiling the <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Add the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and mix it well with the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> until it becomes white and feels light in the hand. Break in two or three <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> at a time, and work the mixture well, before any more is added. Continue doing this until they are all used and it becomes light; then add the <ingredient>spirit,</ingredient> <ingredient>currants,</ingredient> <ingredient>peel,</ingredient> <ingredient>spice,</ingredient> and <ingredient>almonds,</ingredient> some or most of these being previously cut in thin slices, the peel having also been cut into small thin strips and bits. When these are incorporated, mix in the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> lightly: put it in a hoop with paper over the bottom and round the sides, and placed on a <implement>baking-plate.</implement> Large cakes require three or four pieces of stiff paper round the sides; and if the cake is very large, a pipe or funnel, made either of stiff paper or tin, and well buttered, should be put in the centre, and the mixture placed round it; this is to allow the middle of the cake to be well baked, otherwise the edge would be burnt two or three inches deep before it could be properly done. Place the tin plates containing the cake on another, the surface of which is

covered an inch or two thick with sawdust or fine ashes to protect the bottom. Bake it in an oven at a moderate heat. The time required to bake it will depend on the state of the oven and the size of the cake. When the cake is cold, proceed to ice it. (See Icings for Cakes.) Wedding-cakes have generally, first, a coating on the top of <ingredient>almond icing;</ingredient> when this is dry, the sides and top are covered with <ingredient>royal or white icing.</ingredient> Fix on any <ingredient>gum paste or other ornaments</ingredient> whilst it is wet; and when dry, ornament it with <ingredient>piping,</ingredient> <ingredient>orange-blossoms,</ingredient> <ingredient>ribbon,</ingredient> &amp;c.; the surface and sides are often covered with small knobs of <ingredient>white sugar candy</ingredient> whilst the icing is wet.</p>



<p>Twelfth-cakes are iced with <ingredient>white or coloured icing,</ingredient> and decorated with <ingredient>gum paste,</ingredient> <ingredient>plaster ornaments,</ingredient> <ingredient>piping-paste,</ingredient> <ingredient>rings,</ingredient> <ingredient>knots,</ingredient> and <ingredient>fancy papers,</ingredient> &amp;c., and piped.</p>

Tie or pin a piece of buttered paper round the mould, so as to come two or three inches above the bottom. Fix the mould in a stand and nearly fill it. Bake in a moderate oven. When done, the top should be firm and dry. Try it by pushing in a small piece of stick or <implement>whisk,</implement> and if it comes out dry, it is done. The surface of the cake should be quite smooth. There is as much art in buttering the mould properly as in preparing the mixture, if not more.</p>

<recipe class1="breadsweets">



<p>I shall now endeavour to give directions for the composition of this delicate and elegant kind of paste.</p>



 



<pb n="125" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=125"/>







<p><emph rend="italic">Ingredients.</emph>--Twelve ounces of fine-sifted <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> twelve ounces of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> two drachms of <ingredient>fine salt,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>yolks of two eggs.</ingredient></p>



<p><emph rend="italic">Manner of Working.</emph>--Having placed the twelve ounces of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> on the board, make a small hole in the middle; in which, put the two drachms of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> the <ingredient>yolks of two eggs,</ingredient> and nearly a glass of <ingredient>water;</ingredient> and with the ends of the fingers of your right-hand gradually mix in the surrounding <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> adding a little <ingredient>water</ingredient> where necessary, till the paste is of a proper consistence, rather firm than otherwise; then prove it by leaning your hand on the board, and working it for some minutes, when the paste will become soft to the touch, and glossy in appearance.</p>



<p>It is of importance to observe, that this paste should be neither too stiff nor too soft, but of a proper medium; yet it will be better when it is a little too soft than when too stiff.</p>



<p>The same process must be attended to in summer as in winter; though many persons pretend that this kind of paste should be made stiffer in summer than in winter, on account of the difference in the two seasons. As far as regards the hardness of the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> this mode of reasoning has certainly some truth in it; for, inasmuch as the winter is favourable to the work, so does the heat of summer render our operations troublesome and difficult, and prevent them sometimes from having the desired effect, particularly in the making of puff paste.</p>



<p>The reason why summer paste should not be made softer than that made in winter, is this:--if, when the paste is soft, it be buttered, and afterwards placed on ice, as is practised in summer, the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> which is a greasy substance, will become quickly congealed by the coldness of the ice; while the paste, which is only a moist body, will scarcely be affected by it; and, consequently, the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> being frozen, and the paste soft, it will follow that, in working it, the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> not being held by the paste sufficiently firm to unite with it, will break into small pieces; and after having received the two first turns, will appear in small lumps, like large peas. On rolling it again, and placing on the ice, the cold acts with greater force on the small particles of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> which quickly become like so many icicles, and the paste, in consequence, will be completely spoiled; for, in baking, these particles of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> melt, and, separating themselves from the paste, render it incapable of uniting with them.</p>



<p>When the paste has been made as above, take three-quarters of a pound of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> in pieces, which for twenty minutes has been in a pail of <ingredient>spring water,</ingredient> thoroughly imbued with a few pounds of <ingredient>pounded ice</ingredient> previously well washed; then squeeze and work well in a napkin in order to separate the <ingredient>water</ingredient> from it, and at the same time to render it soft, and above all, of an equal consistence; then as quickly as possible roll the paste on a marble slab, into a square, and placing the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in the middle, cover with an equal thickness of paste, by raising the paste over it. After rolling it out two or three feet in length 



 



<pb n="126" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=126"/>







fold it into three parts by doubling one part over the other; after which roll it out again, and fold it once more into three equal parts--now roll it to a greater length, envelope it with a clean linen cloth which has been dusted with some sifted <ingredient>flour</ingredient>--lay this on some finely pounded ice, taking care to have several folds of cloth between the paste and the ice, to prevent the moisture striking through--place on the top of the paste a dish containing some pounded ice--this serves to keep the surface of the paste cool, and also to prevent it becoming soft by the action of the air. After three or four minutes, remove the dish, and turn the paste upside down, instantly covering it a before. This operation should be performed three times in the same manner, and with the same precautions.</p>



<p>Lastly, roll it out two or three times according to what you intend to make of it, and use it as expeditiously as possible, lest the heat of the season should render it too soft to handle, or prevent its having the desired effect in baking.</p>



<p>Thus, in less than half an hour, it is possible to make very fine <purpose>puff paste,</purpose>







having previously everything ready--the ice pounded, the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> frozen, and the oven quite hot, otherwise it cannot be done. This is important, as it is sometimes an hour before the oven can be made hot; and therefore the paste should not be begun to be made till the oven is half heated. The following is another method.]</p>

<p><purpose rend="italic">Family or Home-Baked Bread.</purpose>







--An expeditious and simple method<pb n="133" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=133"/>







of making bread for a small family is as follows:--Take half a bushel of <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> put all this <ingredient>flour</ingredient> excepting about four pounds into a tub or pan, and in winter place it before the fire to warm. Mix six ounces or half a pound of powdered <ingredient>salt</ingredient> with the <ingredient>flour</ingredient>--but it would be better to work the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> in with the dough. Then take a pint of good fresh <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> and well mix it with a sufficient quantity of blood-warm <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Make a deep hole in the middle of the <ingredient>flour;</ingredient>--pour the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> gradually into the hole of the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> mixing the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and <ingredient>flour</ingredient> with your hands till both become well incorporated. Cover this mixture up, and place it near the fire till it has well risen, that is to say, fermented. Then work the other <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into it with your fists, till it becomes a nice, smooth, tough dough. Make this dough into loaves, and bake in an oven properly heated: if too hot, your bread will be burnt outside, and not done inside. It will take from an hour and a half to two hours in baking, but the bread should always remain in the oven half an hour after it has become brown; or, as it is technically called, it will not be soaked through. This is a method we have known to be used with success in many families, though not aware that it ever has been published before.</p>



<p>For large bakings, the following method is best:--</p>



<p><variation>The common way is to put the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into a trough, tub, or pan, sufficiently large to permit its swelling to three times the size it at present occupies. Make a deep hole in the middle of the <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> For half a bushel of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> take a pint of thick fresh <ingredient>yeast</ingredient>--that is, <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> not frothy--mix it with about a pint of <ingredient>soft water</ingredient> made blood-warm. The <ingredient>water</ingredient> must not be hot. Then gently mix with the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> and <ingredient>water</ingredient> as much <ingredient>flour</ingredient> as will bring it to the consistence of a thick or stiff batter--pour this mixture into the hole in the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and cover it by sprinkling it over with <ingredient>flour</ingredient>--lay over it a flannel or sack, and in cold weather place it near, not too near, the fire. This is called laying the sponge. When the sponge--or this mixture of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> and <ingredient>flour</ingredient>--has risen enough to crack the dry <ingredient>flour</ingredient> by which it was covered, sprinkle over the top six ounces of <ingredient>salt</ingredient>--(more or less to suit the taste): mind, the time when the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> is applied is of great importance. We have seen directions in which we are told to mix the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> with the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and <ingredient>yeast.</ingredient> The effect of this would be to prevent fermentation, or, in other words, to prevent the sponge from rising. After the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> is sprinkled over the sponge, work it with the rest of the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and add from time to time <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> (not hot) till the whole is sufficiently moistened; that is, scarcely as moist as pie-crust. The degree of moistness, however, which the mixture ought to possess can only be taught by experience--when the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is mixed with the composition, then work it well by pushing your fists into it--then rolling it out with your hands--folding it up again--kneading it again with your fists, till it is completely mixed, and formed into a stiff, tough, smooth substance, which is called dough--great care must be taken, that your dough be not too moist on the one hand, and on the other that every particle of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> 



 



<pb n="134" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=134"/>







be thoroughly incorporated. Form your dough into a lump like a large dumpling, again cover it up, and keep it warm to rise or ferment. After it has been rising about twenty minutes, or half an hour, make the dough into loaves, first having shaken a little <ingredient>flour</ingredient> over the board to prevent sticking. The loaves may be made up in tin moulds, or if it be desired to make it into loaves to be baked without the use of moulds, divide the dough into equal parts, according to the size you wish to have your loaves--make each part into the form of a dumpling, and lay one dumpling, if we may so speak, upon another--then, the oven being properly heated, by means of an instrument called a <implement>peel,</implement> a sort of wooden shovel, put in your loaves, and immediately shut the door as close as possible. A good deal of nicety is required in properly placing the loaves in the oven--they must be put pretty closely together.

<recipe class1="breadsweets">



<p><purpose rend="italic"><alt synonym1="baker's bread">The Old Method.</alt></purpose>







--To make a sack of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into bread, the baker bakes that quantity of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and empties it into the <implement>kneading trough</implement>--it is then carefully sifted through a <implement>wire sieve,</implement> which makes it lie lighter and reduces any lumps that may have been formed in it. The next process is to dissolve two ounces of <ingredient>alum,</ingredient> technically <emph rend="italic">stuff,</emph> or some call it rocky, in a little <ingredient>water</ingredient> placed over the fire. This is then poured into the <implement>seasoning tub,</implement> and four or five pounds of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> are added to it, with a pailful of <ingredient>water</ingredient> pretty hot, but not too much so. When this mixture, technically <emph rend="italic">liquor,</emph> has cooled to the temperature of about 84&#176;, from three to four pints of <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> are mixed in it, and the whole having been strained through the <implement>seasoning sieve,</implement> is emptied into a hole made in the mass of the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and mixed up with a portion of it to the consistence of thick batter. Dry <ingredient>flour</ingredient> is then sprinkled over the top. This is called the <emph rend="italic">quarter sponge,</emph> and the operation is denominated setting. The sponge must then be covered up with sacks or woollen cloths to keep it warm, if the weather be cold.</p>



<p>In this situation it is left three or four hours, when it gradually swells and breaks through the dry <ingredient>flour</ingredient> laid upon its surface. Another pailful of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> impregnated with <ingredient>alum</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> is now added and well stirred in, and the mass sprinkled with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and covered up as before. This is called setting <emph rend="italic">half sponge.</emph></p>



<p>The whole is then well kneaded, with about two pailsful of more <ingredient>water,</ingredient> for about an hour, when the dough is cut into pieces with a knife; and to prevent it spreading, pinned or kept at one end of the 



 



<pb n="142" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=142"/>







trough by a <implement>pin board.</implement> In this state it is left to <emph rend="italic">prove,</emph> as the bakers call it, for about four hours. After the proving process is over, the dough is again well kneaded for about half an hour. It is then removed from the inside of the trough to its lid, where it is cut into pieces, and weighed into the quantities suitable for each loaf.</p>



<p>The operation of moulding the dough can be learnt only by practice. It consists in cutting the masses of weighed dough, each into two equal parts. They are then kneaded either round or long, and one placed in a hollow made in the other; and the union is completed by a turn of the knuckles on the centre of the upper piece. The loaves are left in the oven from one hour and a half to two hours. They are then taken out, and, to prevent their splitting, are turned their bottom side upwards. They are afterwards covered up with a blanket to prevent as much as possible evaporation, by which weight is lost, and the bread becomes dry and unpalatable.</p>



<p><attribution>Mr. Edlin</attribution> has made one mistake in the above account; namely, as regards the time when the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>alum</ingredient> are incorporated with the <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> These ingredients ought never to be put into the sponge. If they were, the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> would retard the fermentation, and this Mr. Accum as a chemist ought to have known, and not, like many others, have copied and adopted Mr. Edlin's error.</p>



<p>With the exception just alluded to, the foregoing mode of making bread was pursued by the bakers some years ago, and is still practised by some of them; but the following is the process now pursued.</p>

<p><purpose rend="italic"><alt synonym1="baker's bread">Modern Method.</alt></purpose>







--Take a peck of <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> (about eight pounds) and boil them with their skins on--then mash them in the <implement>seasoning tub,</implement> add two or three quarts of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> about the same quantity of <ingredient>patent yeast</ingredient> (as directed to be prepared, page 136), and three or four pounds of <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> stir together well, and cover the mixture up close with a sack, and let it stand from six to twelve hours, when it will have become what is called ferment. Then empty a sack of second <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into the trough--some sift it in--and take a little less than one quarter of the sack of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and pin or block it up to one end of the trough with the <implement>pin-board.</implement> Then bring the <implement>seasoning tub</implement> with the <emph rend="italic">ferment</emph> in it to the trough, pour in a sufficient quantity of <ingredient>warm water</ingredient>--in summer, cold--stir up the mixture with the hands, and mash any lumps of <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> (fruit) that may be in--next, strain it through a sieve for the purpose of separating the skins of the <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> then pour the mixture liquor into the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> which had been previously pinned or blocked up at one end of the trough, and mix it well into the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> with the hands--sprinkle a little <ingredient>flour</ingredient> over the top, and let it stand five or six hours, during which time the sponge will have risen twice. The first rising is suffered to break and go down. In about an hour or so, according to the heat of the bakehouse, the sponge rises a second time, and just as it is about again to break, or when the air escapes by the bursting of the bubbles, a sufficient quantity of <ingredient>water</ingredient> (about three pailsful) to make up the batch is poured into the sponge from the <implement>seasoning tub,</implement> the <ingredient>water</ingredient> having dissolved in it previously 



 



<pb n="143" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=143"/>







about four pounds of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and eight ounces of what is called stuff--(some use more than a pound or sixteen ounces of stuff). The liquor ought to be well mixed with the sponge; which being done, the <implement>pin-board</implement> is taken away, and the whole of the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> is well worked up into one mass, which is blocked up by the <implement>pin-board</implement> to one end, and left about an hour in summer, and two hours in winter, to prove; the vacant part of the trough is then sprinkled with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> to prevent the dough from sticking, the <implement>pin-board</implement> is knocked out, and the dough is pitched out of the trough on to the lid of the opposite trough, when it is cut into masses and weighed--technically <emph rend="italic">scaled off.</emph> These masses are then moulded into shape and put aside in a regular manner, to be finally moulded into loaves, taking care to mould those first which were first <emph rend="italic">scaled off.</emph> Previous to the moulding, the oven must be well <emph rend="italic">swabbed out,</emph> or cleaned with the <implement>swabber</implement> or <implement>scuttle,</implement> and the up-sets chalked to prevent the bread sticking to them. They are then placed at the back and on each side of the oven by means of the peel; the long loaves, or the quartern and half-quartern bricks, are put into the oven, packed together as close as possible--the common round bread is also packed close--but the cottage bread must be placed separately, each loaf by itself, or it will not be crusted all round. After placing the loaves in the oven, or, as the bakers say, <emph rend="italic">setting the batch,</emph> which requires a good hand to do properly, an up-set is placed in front of it. The <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> for the next <emph rend="italic">ferment</emph> are put into a tin or iron kettle, generally round, but sometimes in the form of a <implement>fish-kettle,</implement> and placed in the oven to boil. When the <ingredient>potatoes are done,</ingredient> and while they are hot, the ferment for the next batch must be mixed. Twenty-four hours elapse from the mixing the ferment to the time when the bread is taken out of the oven.</p>

<recipe class1="breadsweets">



<p><purpose rend="italic">Debretzen Bread.</purpose>







--In some parts of Hungary, Debretzen for instance, they have a peculiar mode of fermenting bread without yeast, by means of a leaven made in the following manner. Two large handsful of <ingredient>hops</ingredient> are boiled in four quarts of <ingredient>water;</ingredient> this decoction is poured upon as much <ingredient>wheaten bran</ingredient> as it will moisten, and to this are added four or five pounds of <ingredient>leaven.</ingredient> When the mass is warm, the ingredients are well worked together, so as to be thoroughly mixed. It is then deposited in a warm place for twenty-four hours, and afterwards divided into small pieces, about the size of hens' eggs, which are dried by being placed upon a board and exposed to dry air, but not to the sun; when dry, they are laid up for use, and may be kept for six months.</p>



 



<pb n="149" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=149"/>







<p>The following is given as the mode by which bread is made from the above-described ferment. For baking six large loaves, six good handsful of these balls are dissolved in seven or eight quarts of <ingredient>warm water</ingredient>--this mixture is poured through a sieve at one end of the <implement>bread-trough,</implement> and after it three quarts of <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> the remaining mass being well pressed out. The liquor is mixed up with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> sufficient to form one large loaf; they then strew this mass over with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> the sieve with its contents is put upon it, and the whole is covered up and kept warm and left to rise, or till the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> upon it begins to crack. Fifteen quarts of <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> in which six handsful of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> have been dissolved, are then poured upon it through the sieve; the necessary quantity of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> is added, and the whole is well kneaded together. The dough is then covered up and kept warm for half an hour. It is then formed into loaves which are kept for another half hour in a warm room; and after that they are put into an oven, where they remain for two or three hours according to their size.</p>



<p>There is certainly an advantage in this kind of ferment--which is, its capability of keeping for a long time, and of being made in large quantities. On this account it would be convenient on board of ships, or in the camp of an army.</p>

<p><purpose rend="italic">Bread Fruit Bread.</purpose>







--To prepare the fruit for use instead of bread, it must be roasted, either whole, or cut into three or four pieces. It is also cooked in an oven, which renders it soft, and something like a boiled potatoe; not quite so mealy as a good one, but more so than those of an inferior description. The Otaheitans make three dishes of it, by putting either <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or the <ingredient>milk of cocoa-nut</ingredient> to it, then beating it to a paste with a stone <implement>pestle,</implement> and afterwards mixing it with ripe <ingredient>plantains,</ingredient> <ingredient>bananas,</ingredient> or <ingredient>mahie.</ingredient></p>



<p>This mahie is a preparation of the ripe <ingredient>bread fruit,</ingredient> for which it is substituted during the season, just before gathering a fresh crop. It is made thus:--The fruit is gathered just before it is perfectly ripe, and being laid in heaps, is closely covered with leaves; in this state it undergoes a fermentation, and becomes disagreeably sweet. The core is then taken out entire, by gently pulling the stalk, and the fruit is thrown into a hole which is dug for that purpose, generally in the houses, and neatly lined in the bottom and sides with grass; the whole is then covered with leaves, and heavy stones laid upon them. In this state it undergoes a second fermentation, and becomes sour; after which it undergoes no change for many months. It is taken out of the hole as it is wanted for use, and being made into balls, it is wrapped up in leaves, and roasted or baked. After it is baked, it will keep five or six weeks. It is eaten both cold and hot, and the natives seldom make a meal without it.

The <ingredient>water</ingredient> is then poured off, and the meal, being properly dried, is formed into cakes, or fermented and made into bread, which, it is said, is nearly as palatable as wheaten bread. The Hottentots make a kind of bread from another species of sago tree. The pith of this tree is collected, and tied up in dressed calf, or sheep-skin, and then buried in the ground for several weeks, which renders it mellow and tender. It is then made into cakes, which are baked under hot embers. Others roast the <ingredient>sago tree pith,</ingredient> and make it into a kind of porridge.</p>

<p><purpose rend="italic">Casava Bread</purpose>







--is made in the Caribbee Islands, from a very poisonous root called <ingredient rend="italic">Jatropa Maniat,</ingredient> rendered wholesome by the extraction of its acrid <ingredient>juice,</ingredient> which the Indians use for poisoning their arrows. So powerfully poisonous is this <ingredient>juice,</ingredient> that a tea-spoonful is sufficient to take away the life of a man. The <ingredient>root of the <emph rend="italic">maniat,</emph></ingredient> after being washed, scraped clean, and grated in a tub, is enclosed in a sack made of rushes, of very loose texture. This sack is suspended upon a stick placed upon two wooden forks. A heavy vessel is suspended to the bottom of the sack, and is so contrived as to press the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> out of the roots. When the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> is all taken from the roots, they become a sort of starch, which is exposed to smoke in order to dry it; when well dried, it is passed through a sieve: it is now called casava. It is baked into cakes by laying it on hot plates of iron, or on hot earth. The article called <emph rend="italic">tapioca</emph> is the finest part of casava, collected and formed into small tears, by straining the mass, while it is still moist, so as to make it into small irregular lumps.</p>

<p><purpose rend="italic">Plantain Bread</purpose>







--is made from the fruit of the <ingredient>plantain</ingredient> tree. This fruit is about a foot long, and from an inch and a half to two inches in diameter, and has a tough skin, within which there is a soft pulp, of a sweet flavour. The fruit is generally cut when green; the skin is taken off, and the heart is roasted in a clear cold fire for a few minutes: it is then scraped, and served up as bread. This tree is a native of the East Indies, and other parts of the Asiatic continent, but is cultivated on an extensive scale in Jamaica. It is said, that without this fruit the West India islands would be scarcely inhabitable, as no species of provisions could supply its place. Wheaten bread flour is not so agreeable to the negroes, and they greatly prefer it to the fruit of the bread tree.</p>

pounds and upwards. The pulp of the <ingredient>banana</ingredient> tree is softer than that of the plantain tree, and of a more luscious taste. When ripe it is a very pleasant food, either undressed, or fried in slices like fritters. All classes of people in the West Indies are very fond of it. When preparing for a voyage, they take the ripe fruit and squeeze it through a sieve; then form the mass into loaves, which are dried in the sun, or baked on hot ashes, having been previously wrapped up in leaves.</p>

<p><purpose rend="italic">Moss Bread,</purpose>







or bread made of moss, is prepared from a species of the tribe <emph rend="italic">lichen,</emph> called <ingredient>rein-deer moss,</ingredient> which contains a considerable quantity of starch. The Icelanders form the <emph rend="italic">lichen islandicus</emph> into bread, and it is said to be very nutritive. The moss is collected in the summer, dried, and ground into powder--of which bread gruel and pottage are made. It is also boiled in <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>whey,</ingredient> till it comes to a jelly. It should be previously steeped some hours in <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> in order to extract the bitter matter with which it is impregnated, which is not only disagreeable as to taste, but is also a purgative.</p>

--We have shown that a great variety of substances are used as substitutes for flour bread. We now come to <ingredient>dried fish,</ingredient> which appears to be an odd thing to make bread of.
