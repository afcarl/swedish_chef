<p>No 239. <purpose rend="italic" align="center">Preparing Coffee.</purpose>







</p>



<p>In order to roast <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> properly, the uses of roasting must not be lost sight of, namely, to destroy the hornlike tenacity of the green bean, and to develope its fine scent. Too much heat would destroy the chemical elements which ought to be preserved, and would substitute in their place others which are entirely different in quality. That fine scent which pleases so greatly the admirer of good <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> is succeeded, when the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is over-



<pb n="69" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=notm&#38;PageNum=71"/>



roasted, by a bitter taste and burnt smell, which is far from pleasant, and even disagreeable.--If on the other hand, the roasting process is under-done, and the heat to which the <ingredient>beans</ingredient> have been exposed, has not been sufficient, then the raw smell of the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> remains, and of course diminishes the aroma, which requires a certain heat to devlope it. There is of course a just medium to be observed. Well roasted <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> ought to have a pale chocolate colour equally spread over it, which is well known to those who are in the use of performing this operation; but it is never necessary to look at the roasted <ingredient>beans,</ingredient> the scent is sufficient; for when the true aroma is developed, and fills the surrounding atmosphere with its delicious scent, then is the time to stop the roasting. After this period, the oil acquires a burnt flavour, a scent somewhat resembling that exhaled by smokers of tobacco is perceived, and instead of good roasted <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> there is obtained a bad kind of charcoal.</p>



<p>Good raw <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> loses from sixteen to twenty per cent of its weight by roasting; if it loses more it is certainly over-roasted. Many different modes are used, and each has its admirers; but there is in fact only a single rule to be observed, namely, to use the proper degree of heat, and keep it up at the same point until the roasting is finished. Whether the roasting is performed in close or open vessels; whether the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is left to cool in the <implement>roaster,</implement> or is turned out, or even laid between cloths, appears indifferent. If, indeed, the roasting is carried by accident too far, the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> should be immediately spread out thin on the floor, to 



<pb n="70" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=notm&#38;PageNum=72"/>



cool as soon as possible. In all cases, when cold, the roasted <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> should be put up into tin-plate boxes, and kept from any moisture.</p>



<p>It being well known that the chemical action of solvents is hastened, in general by reducing the solvent to powder; it is necessary to grind the roasted <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> more or less fine, as it is intended to use the <ingredient>water</ingredient> less or more heated. To reduce <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> to too fine a powder, although <alt synonym1="it">it it</alt> would require only slightly <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> to extract its soluble parts, yet it would be inconvenient in other respects, for the powder would pass through the strainers of the <implement>coffee pot,</implement> and by also remaining suspended in the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> would render the clearing of the drink difficult. At all events, roasted <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> should never be ground but the moment before it is used, as otherwise it loses much of its fine scent.</p>



<p>It now remains only to say a few words respecting the making of the ground roasted <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> into drink--and here the grand points are, not to lose the fine aroma, and not to extract the bitter, acrid, resinous element of the coffee.--To avoid both these inconveniencies, it is necessary that the coffee drink should not be made with too much heat; as this would dissipate the aroma in vapours, and cause the <ingredient>water</ingredient> to dissolve the resin. The <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> therefore, must not be boiled in the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and still less is it proper to boil the grounds over again with fresh <ingredient>water,</ingredient> as is done by some persons. Coffee drink made from the grounds, when it is added to that made from fresh ground <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> gives it indeed a fine deep colour, but the taste of the drink is very bad.</p>



<pb n="71" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=notm&#38;PageNum=73"/>



<p>It is not even necessary to pour boiling or even warm water on the ground <ingredient>coffee;</ingredient> <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> if sufficient time is allowed, makes equally good coffee drink, for the elements to be extracted from the roasted <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> are extremely soluble in <ingredient>water.</ingredient> But if the coffee drink is required to be prepared in haste, <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> must be used.</p>



<p>It is uiversally agreed on by the French amateurs of <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> that coffee drink is never so good as when, after being made with <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> or with <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> and cooled, it is heated over again, carefully avoiding a boiling heat. This heating over again is supposed to cause the various elements which produce the fine flavour of this drink, to unite more intimately; and this may be the real fact. The excellence of the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> sold at Paris is well known; and this is always made one day and heated over again the next day, when wanted. A further advantage attends this knowledge, of consequence to single persons who, in summer time, do not keep a fire in their chambers, that by merely pouring <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> on the ground <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> over night, and straining it in the morning, the strained liquor may while they are dressing, be heated sufficiently for drinking, over a lamp; and this gives <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> a superiority over tea for the breakfast of such persons; as tea requires the <ingredient>water</ingredient> to be boiling hot, in order to extract its virtues; and of course <alt synonym1="requires">reqnires</alt> a fire to be lighted.</p>
