<p>WINES.--<purpose>CURRANT, CHERRY, AND OTHER BERRY WINES.</purpose>--The <ingredient>juice</ingredient> of either of the above <ingredient>fruits</ingredient> can be used alone, or in combinations to make a variety of flavors, or suit persons who have some, and not the other kinds of <ingredient>fruit.</ingredient></p>



<p>Express all the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> you can, then take an equal amount of <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> and pour on the pressed <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> let stand 2 hours, squeeze out as much as there is of <ingredient>juice,</ingredient> and mix, then add 4 lbs. of <ingredient>brown sugar</ingredient> to each gallon of the mixture; let stand until worked, or 3 or 4 weeks, without a bung in the keg or barrel, simply putting a piece of gauze over the bung hole to keep out flies; when it is done working, bung it up.</p>



<p>A cool cellar, of course, is the best place for keeping wines, as they must be kept where they will not freeze. Some persons use only one-fourth <ingredient>juice,</ingredient> in making fruit wines, and three-fourths <ingredient>water,</ingredient> but you will bear in mind

that the wine will be good or bad, just in proportion to the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> used. If care is used when you express the <ingredient>juice,</ingredient> to prevent the pulp or seeds from entering or remaining in the <ingredient>juice,</ingredient> no other straining or racking will be needed. Most persons also recommend putting in <ingredient>brandy,</ingredient> but if any spirit is used at all, let it be pure <ingredient>alcohol,</ingredient> from one gill to one-half pint only per gallon, but the strength of <ingredient>juice</ingredient> I recommend, and the amount of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> remove all necessity for any addition of spirit whatever. Bear in mind that all <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> of which you are to make <ingredient>wine</ingredient> ought to be perfectly ripe, and then make it as soon as possible thereafter, not letting the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> ferment before the addition of the <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient> If bottled, always lay them on the side.</p>

<p>PRESERVES--<purpose>TOMATO PRESERVES.</purpose>--As some persons will have <ingredient>preserves,</ingredient> I give them the plan of making the most healthy of any in use:</p>



<p>Take ripe, scalded and peeled <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> 13 lbs.; nice, scalding hot <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> 1 gal.; pour the <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> upon them and let stand 12 hours; then boil until they are properly cooked; now skim out the <ingredient>tomatoes,</ingredient> but continue boiling the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> until quite thick; then pour again upon the <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> and put away as other <ingredient>preserves.</ingredient> A table-spoon of <ingredient>ginger</ingredient> tied up in a bit of cloth and boiled in them, gives a nice flavor; or the extracts can be used; or <ingredient>lemon peel,</ingredient> as preferred--if <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is used, pound for pound is the amount.</p>



<p>But I prefer to put them, or any other <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> into jugs, cans, or bottles, which retains the natural flavor and does not injure the stomach, which all <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> do, to a greater or less extent. Yet I give you another, because it does so nicely in place of citron, in cakes.</p>

<p><purpose>CURRANTS--TO DRY WITH SUGAR.</purpose>--Take fully ripe <ingredient>currants,</ingredient> stemmed, 5 lbs.; <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> 1 lb.; put into a brass kettle, stirring at first, then as the <ingredient>currants</ingredient> boil up to the top, skim them off; boil down the juicy <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> until quite thick and pour it over the <ingredient>currants,</ingredient> mixing well; then place on suitable dishes, and dry them by placing in a low box over which you can place musketo-bar, to keep away flies.</p>



<p>When properly dried, put in jars and tie <ingredient>paper</ingredient> over them. Put <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> upon them and stew as other <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> for eating or pie-making, adding more <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> if desired.</p>

<p><purpose>COFFEE--MORE HEALTHY AND BETTER FLAVORED, FOR ONE-FOURTH THE EXPENSE OF COMMON.</purpose>--Coffee, by weight or measure, one-fourth, <ingredient>rye</ingredient> three-fourths.</p>



<p>Look them over separately, to remove bad grains; then wash to remove dust, draining off the <ingredient>water</ingredient> for a moment as you take it with the hands, from the washing <ingredient>water,</ingredient> putting directly into the browning skillet, carefully stirring, all the time, to brown it evenly. Brown each one separately; then mix evenly, and grind only as used; settling with a beaten <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> <ingredient>seasoning</ingredient> with a little <ingredient>cream</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> as usual.</p>



<p>And I do sincerely say the flavor is better, and it is one hundred per cent more healthy than all <ingredient>coffee.</ingredient></p>



<p><variation>You may try <ingredient>barley,</ingredient> <ingredient>peas,</ingredient> <ingredient>parsnips,</ingredient> <ingredient>dandelion roots,</ingredient> &#38;c., but none of their flavore are equal to <ingredient>rye.</ingredient> Yet all of them are more or less used for <ingredient>coffee.</ingredient></variation></p>

<p>PICKLING FRUITS, AND CUCUMBERS--<purpose>PICKLING APPLES.</purpose>--Best <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> 1 gal.; <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> 4 lbs.; <ingredient>apples</ingredient> all it will cover handsomely; <ingredient>cinnamon</ingredient> and <ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> ground, of each 1 tablespoon.</p>



<p>Pare and core the <ingredient>apples,</ingredient> tying up the <ingredient>cinnamon</ingredient> and <ingredient>cloves</ingredient> in a cloth and putting with the <ingredient>apples,</ingredient> into the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and cooking until done, only. Keep in jars. They are nicer than <ingredient>preserves,</ingredient> and more healthy, and keep a long time; not being too sour, nor too sweet, but an agreeable mixture of the two. It will be seen below that the different <ingredient>fruits</ingredient> require different quantities of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> the reason for it, is, the difference in the <ingredient>fruit.</ingredient></p>

<p>3. <purpose>PEACHES--TO PEEL.</purpose>--In peeling small <ingredient>peaches</ingredient> with a knife, too much of the <ingredient>peach</ingredient> is wasted; but by having a wire-cage, similar to those made for popping <ingredient>corn;</ingredient> fill the cage with <ingredient>peaches</ingredient> and dip it into <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> for a moment, then into <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> for a moment and empty out; going on in the same way for all you wish to peel. This toughens the skin and enables you to strip it off, saving much in labor, as also the waste of <ingredient>peach.</ingredient> Why not, as well as <ingredient>tomatoes?</ingredient></p>
