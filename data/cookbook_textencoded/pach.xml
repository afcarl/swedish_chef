<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">SHELL-FISH ON THE HALF-SHELL (HU&#238;TRES).</purpose>







THE custom generally prevails in this country, of beginning every dinner, where there is any attempt at formality, with small shell-fish served on the half-shell. Even in the inland towns, <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> and <ingredient>hard clams</ingredient> can usually be procured, for they are now shipped in barrels from the eastern seaboard to all parts of the country accessible by rail. Sometimes a fine grade of canned <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> is served on plates painted to imitate five or six half <ingredient>oyster-shells;</ingredient> but great care should be exercised, if this is done, to have the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> used directly the can is opened; if there is the slightest taint, or deterioration from exposure to the air, the success of the dinner will be marred. Indeed, it is best to omit this first service of <ingredient>shell-fish,</ingredient> unless they can be freshly taken from the shells. The proper accompaniments for raw shell-fish are <ingredient>lemon</ingredient> and <ingredient>brown bread</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> both of which are placed upon the table when it is laid.</p>

Choose the smallest plump <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> which can be obtained. In the New-York markets, all very small <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> in good condition for serving on the half-shell are called Blue-Points.

The small native <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> of California are excellent, having the coppery taste so much esteemed by European epicures. The small <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> of the southern Atlantic seaboard are delicious. Have the shells of the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> liberally dashed with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> to free them from mud, and then open them, loosening the <ingredient>oyster</ingredient> from both sides of the shell by dividing the muscle variously called the "eye" and the "heart" (both terms are erroneous); take off the shallow half of the shell, leaving the <ingredient>oyster</ingredient> lying loose in the deep part, carefully removing all bits of shell which may be broken in opening the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient>: if the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> are carefully opened, very little of the shell will be broken. Arrange the deep half-shells containing the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> upon plates, five or six on each plate, with the smallest part of the shell towards the centre of the plate; put a quarter of a <ingredient>lemon</ingredient> in the midst of the <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> and have more <ingredient>lemon</ingredient> upon the table, together with several plates of <ingredient>brown bread,</ingredient> cut very thin and buttered and then folded to enclose the <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Do not dish the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> until just as they are wanted for the table: they may be opened, arranged in the deep shells on a large pan or tray, and kept in the <implement>ice-box</implement> until just before serving them. The plates containing the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> are placed upon the tables just before the guests enter the dining-room.</p>

This method of icing <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> is more suitable for luncheon, or for a gentlemen's supper, than for a dinner-service. A block of clear ice is best: snow-ice, or that which is opaque and full of air-holes, melts more quickly than clear ice. Make a slight hollow in the upper surface of the ice, and lay the deep half-shells containing the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> in this cavity; place the block of ice on a dish large enough to contain all the <ingredient>water</ingredient> from the melting ice, and then at once serve the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> on the block of ice.

The <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> might be partly opened, care being taken not to lose their liquor, and then packed around and upon the block of ice, with their deep shells undermost: the opening would then be a comparatively simple matter. Of course, this service of <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> necessitates an ample supply of napery, and sometimes an entire change of the table-linen.</p>

A caterer's device for serving raw <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> at a dinner of sixteen persons may be noted. Hollow shapes had been frozen to represent <ingredient>apples</ingredient> made of ice, the upper half movable and lifted by a stem; the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> were placed in the lower section of the <ingredient>apple,</ingredient> which was set on a small <implement>doily</implement> laid on a plate: a few bits of <ingredient>parsley</ingredient> made a pretty garnish. The objection to this method of icing the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> was, that the melting of the ice-<ingredient>apple</ingredient> plunged them in a bath of <ingredient>ice-water;</ingredient> while the hollow at the bottom of the interior of the <ingredient>apple</ingredient> collected the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> in a wet mass. They lost not only their natural flavor, but also their individuality: one of the excellences of the service on the half-shell is that each bivalve reaches the consumer in its legitimate habitat, and surrounded by its own distinctive liquor.</p>



<p>When half-shells are not obtainable, the fancy <ingredient>oyster</ingredient>-plates might be iced by being left for an hour or longer in the <implement>ice-box,</implement> so that they would speedily cool the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> placed upon them; or a thin film of ice might be frozen over them, by exposing them to a freezing temperature with a little <ingredient>water</ingredient> in each one: this, however, would make the

When it is impossible to obtain fresh <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> for the half-shell service before dinner, a partial substitute may be made from canned <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> by carefully following the details of this recipe. The <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> will be most presentable if served on the fancy <ingredient>oyster</ingredient>-plates which imitate the shells; and they must be absolutely cold.</p>



<p>From a can of fine <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> select the largest and fattest; see that no bits of shell adhere to them, and drain them on a sieve; put their liquor over the fire with an equal quantity of <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> and enough <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> to cover the <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> and let the <ingredient>broth</ingredient> thus made boil, removing all scum as it rises. When the <ingredient>broth</ingredient> is quite free from scum, throw the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> into it, and watch them closely; the instant they become full and plump, skim them out of the <ingredient>broth,</ingredient> and again lay them on the sieve to drain. A very little time will suffice to make the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> plump: if they are allowed to cook until they shrivel, they will be spoiled for this dish. As soon as the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> are placed on the sieve, cover them with a cloth wet in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and let them cool; when they are entirely cold, arrange them on the fancy <ingredient>oyster</ingredient>-plates, and serve them cold, with <ingredient>lemon and brown bread</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter.</ingredient></p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">SOUP STOCK.</purpose>







THE same general directions in regard to boiling, clarifying, and coloring <ingredient>soup-stock,</ingredient> will apply to the making of any clear soup or <emph rend="italic">bouillon:</emph> the difference is in the ingredients used, and the flavor which results. Ordinary <ingredient>stock</ingredient> may be prepared in about three hours; but when a gelatinous <ingredient>stock</ingredient> is desired, the boiling must be continued for five or six hours in order to extract the <ingredient>gelatine</ingredient> from the bones. While the <ingredient>gelatine</ingredient> thickens soup, it does not add to its nutriment; and unless the <implement>soup-kettle</implement> is kept very closely covered while the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> is boiling, much of its flavor and some of its substance will escape with the steam during long-continued boiling.</p>



<p>To make <ingredient>stock</ingredient> for an ordinary clear soup, use <ingredient>beef</ingredient> cut from the <ingredient>neck</ingredient> or <ingredient>leg,</ingredient> including a <ingredient>marrow-bone;</ingredient> allow a pound of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and <ingredient>bone</ingredient> for each quart of <ingredient>stock.</ingredient> Trim off any defective parts, and wipe the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> with a wet towel; cut the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> from the <ingredient>bone</ingredient> in rather large pieces, so that it may be used for hashes or potted <ingredient>meat;</ingredient> there is still some nourishment remaining in it after the soup is made, and it retains a pleasant flavor from the vegetables and <ingredient>seasoning</ingredient> used in the soup; it is only the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> remaining from <ingredient>beef-tea</ingredient> which has little food value or flavor. After the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is cut from the <ingredient>bones,</ingredient> have the <ingredient>bones</ingredient> broken in rather small pieces, and lay them in the bottom of the <implement>soup-kettle;</implement> put the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> on the <ingredient>bones,</ingredient> and add <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> in the proportion of one quart of 



 



<pb n="169" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=199"/>







<ingredient>water</ingredient> to one pound of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and <ingredient>bone;</ingredient> set the kettle over the fire, cover it, and heat its contents until they boil, removing all scum as it rises; the scum is composed of blood and albumen, and is to be saved to add to any thick brown soup or <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> because it is nutritious; the object of removing it in making <ingredient>stock</ingredient> is to leave the <ingredient>broth</ingredient> clear; a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> added while the scum is rising will hasten the operation.</p>



<p>While the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> is being thus freed from scum, prepare the vegetables as follows: To four quarts of <ingredient>stock</ingredient> allow one medium-size <ingredient>carrot</ingredient> scraped, one medium-size <ingredient>turnip</ingredient> peeled, one medium-size <ingredient>onion</ingredient> peeled, without cutting the top or root close, or breaking the layers apart; stick into the <ingredient>onion</ingredient> a dozen whole <ingredient>cloves;</ingredient> wash one medium-size root of <ingredient>parsley</ingredient> with the stalks and leaves attached, lay the leafy part in the palm of the left hand, in the midst of the leaves place a dozen whole <ingredient>peppercorns,</ingredient> a small blade of <ingredient>mace,</ingredient> a small bay-leaf, and one sprig of any <ingredient>dried sweet herb</ingredient> except <ingredient>sage;</ingredient> if <ingredient>celery</ingredient> is in season, one of the smaller green stalks or about half a dozen of the green leaves may be added; and then the <ingredient>parsley root</ingredient> and leaves wrapped around the other seasonings, and the little bunch tied compactly with cord. After all the scum has been removed from the <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> put in the vegetables, together with two teaspoonfuls of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and replace the cover of the <implement>soup-kettle.</implement> Let the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> boil gently for two hours or longer. If the kettle is placed so that the heat strikes it from one side, causing the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> to boil from one side, the soup will be clearer after it is strained than if the boiling is taking place in all parts of the kettle at once.</p>



<p>When the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> has boiled the desired length of time, lay a folded clean towel in a <implement>colander</implement> set over an earthen bowl or jar large enough to hold the <ingredient>stock;</ingredient> take up the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and set it aside to use in any dish of the nature indicated above; the vegetables may be chopped and combined with some 



 



<pb n="170" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=200"/>







of the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> in the form of a hash, which should be highly seasoned. Pour the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> through the towel, letting it run through without stirring or squeezing it to disturb the little sediment which will remain upon the towel; when all the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> has run through the towel, remove the <implement>colander,</implement> put a sieve or a piece of <implement>cheese-cloth</implement> over the bowl or jar, to protect the <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> and let it cool. If a close earthen or metal cover were used, the steam from the hot <ingredient>stock</ingredient> would condense upon its inner surface, and partly sour; falling back into the <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> it would deteriorate the whole. When the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> is entirely cold, the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> which forms on the surface in a cake can be removed, and both the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> and the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> clarified in accordance with the recipes given below.</p>

When the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> is quite cold, remove the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> from the surface; for each quart of <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> allow the <ingredient>white</ingredient> and shell of one <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> and a tablespoonful of <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> put these ingredients into a saucepan, and mix them together, then pour in the <ingredient>stock;</ingredient> set the saucepan over the fire, and heat its contents gradually, stirring occasionally to prevent the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> sticking to the bottom of the saucepan. Allow the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> to heat and boil gently; the albumen of the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> will entangle all the cloudy particles floating in the <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> and thus clarify it; let the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> boil until it looks perfectly clear under the <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> that will rise and <ingredient>float</ingredient> upon the surface in the form of a thick white scum, under which the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> will show a clear <ingredient>amber</ingredient> color; when it has boiled long enough to insure this appearance, pour it into a folded towel laid in a <implement>colander</implement> set over an earthen bowl; let the soup run through the towel without moving or squeezing it.

As several dishes can be made from one <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> the reader's attention is called to the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> recipes which are given elsewhere.</p>



<p>To prepare the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> for the soup, cut one-fourth of the flesh away from the bone and skin, reserving the rest for other dishes, and boil it, putting it over the fire in boiling <ingredient>salted water,</ingredient> and cooking it until the flakes begin to separate. Then drain it, and rub it through a sieve with a <implement>potato-masher.</implement> Allow one cupful of <ingredient>fish</ingredient> for each quart of soup.</p>



<p>To make two quarts of soup, put two tablespoonfuls each of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into a saucepan, and set it over a gentle fire; stir constantly until the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>flour</ingredient> are smoothly blended, then gradually stir in two quarts of hot <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> adding half a cupful at a time, and stirring it smooth before putting in more. When all the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is mixed with the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> season the soup with two teaspoonfuls of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and quarter of a salt-spoonful each of <ingredient>white pepper</ingredient> and grated <ingredient>nutmeg.</ingredient> Next, put in the <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> and stir the soup with an <implement>egg-whip</implement> until it boils; then serve it hot.

The cuts of <ingredient>turtle</ingredient> copied from Dubois, and given in the chapter on Soups, show the upper and under shell of a green <ingredient>turtle,</ingredient> and one manner of killing it, by laying it upon a sloping table after the throat is cut, and allowing it to bleed; another method is to hang it by the hind fins, with the head down, and so let it bleed. The under shell, or calipee, is of a yellowish-white color; and the upper shell, or calipash, a dark green, almost black. The weight varies from about fifty pounds to over five hundred. Full directions for killing and dressing green <ingredient>turtle</ingredient> are given in the recipe for <ingredient>turtle-soup</ingredient>.</p>

These cheap and excellent <ingredient>shell-fish</ingredient> are generally prepared for market by pickling; but many good dishes can be made from them, for several of which recipes are given elsewhere. The shells of <ingredient>mussels</ingredient> in good condition are dark and bright, and the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> fills them plumply. The edges of the shells are sharp and firmly closed. If they are at all muddy or sandy, they should be laid for an hour or longer in a tub of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> containing a handful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and then thoroughly washed before they are boiled.</p>



<p>To boil <ingredient>mussels,</ingredient> place them in a large kettle, after they are thoroughly washed, with half a pint of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and set them over the fire until the shells open; the liquor which flows from them should be carefully strained, and kept to use with them. After the <ingredient>mussels</ingredient> are boiled, take them from the shells, carefully remove all the fine filaments attached to the "tongue" or "foot" of the <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> cut off the tip of the "<ingredient>tongue</ingredient>" and the dark, fringe-like edge, or beard, which surrounds the gills; the thread-like filaments are called the "moss," and this is supposed to be more or less poisonous. The office of the moss, or byssus, is to attach the <ingredient>mussel</ingredient> to the rocks or wharves where it is found. It should always be carefully removed before the <ingredient>mussel</ingredient> is dressed, after it is boiled. Some cooks always use a silver spoon in preparing <ingredient>mussels</ingredient> for the table, thinking that it will become blackened if they are unfit for food.</p>



<p><ingredient>Mussels</ingredient> are sometimes eaten raw like <ingredient>oysters;</ingredient> but this is not advisable, because some medical authorities assert that the <ingredient>mussel</ingredient> occasionally contains a poisonous substance which is neutralized by cooking, as is the case with some varieties of <ingredient>mushrooms.</ingredient> Cases of poisoning by <ingredient>mussels</ingredient> yield to intelligent medical treatment.</p>

The accompanying engraving shows a <ingredient>cutlet,</ingredient> trimmed from the rack or <ingredient>neck,</ingredient> and laid upon a sheet of buttered or oiled writing-paper, cut in the shape of a very wide heart, ready to be enveloped in the paper; this is done by a series of little folds turned from the edges of the paper, after it is folded over the <ingredient>cutlet,</ingredient> toward the middle, somewhat like a hem upon a piece of cloth. Only very delicate cutlets are cooked in paper, or small, choice pieces of <ingredient>fish</ingredient> or <ingredient>game;</ingredient> all the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> is preserved by the paper. The <ingredient>oil</ingredient> or <ingredient>butter</ingredient> applied to the paper prevents its burning if the <ingredient>cutlet</ingredient> is cooked over a moderate fire. A thin <ingredient>cutlet,</ingredient> or a small bird, generally requires about fifteen minutes to cook medium rare.

To make the double frill at the bottom of the picture, cut a circle of paper, six or seven inches in diameter; fold it through the middle, and repeat the folding three times more until a long triangle is formed of sixteen thicknesses of paper; take the folds between the left thumb and forefinger; with scissors cut from the lower ends of the folds, a curve to half way up the other side of the triangle, which shows only one fold; with the aid of the closed scissors, or the back of a small knife-blade, make a succession of small, scallop-like folds along the curved cut just made, pressing the folds from the lower end, where the cut began, up towards the point of the triangle, so as to give the edges of the curves a crimped appearance; if the crimps are made small and tight enough, they will retain their form when the circle of paper is unfolded, as shown by the lettered points in the second figure of the illustration; by refolding them a little it will be possible to make the completed frill, the first figure being run into a hole cut in the middle of the crimped circle.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">PASTRY FOR MEAT AND GAME PIES.</purpose>







Use half a pound of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> to a pound of <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> chop one-half the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> into the <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> add a level teaspoonful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and enough <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> to mix it to a smooth <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> just soft enough to roll out. If <ingredient>ice-water</ingredient> is used, and the pastry is mixed with a knife instead of the hand, it can be kept <implement>cooler,</implement> and will be lighter and more delicate than if mixed with the hands. In all the making, touch the pastry as little and as lightly as possible with the hands, because heating it and pressing heavily upon it make it dense and tough. After the pastry is mixed, and rolled about half an inch thick, dredge it with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> cut half the remaining <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in slices, and lay it on the pastry, leaving a space of about an inch all around the edges; dredge it with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> cut half the remaining <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in slices, and lay it on the pastry, leaving a space of about an inch all around the edges; dredge the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> turn the edges in all around to enclose the outside layers of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and then double the pastry, and again roll it out about half an inch thick; put the rest of the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> on it in slices, dredge it with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> fold in the edges, double it, and roll it out as already directed; work very quickly and lightly, touching the pastry as little as possible, and in the coldest place about the kitchen. Remember that it is heating and pressing pastry that make it heavy and soggy. If any pastry remains after the pie is made, wrap it in <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed cloth, and keep it in a cool, dry place: it will keep quite well for several days, and requires only to be rolled out two or three times before using it to make it quite light.</p>

The old English <ingredient>venison</ingredient> pasty was made in a very large dish, simply because of the number of persons generally included in a household. A very good small one can be made in such a dish as is shown in the picture accompanying the preceding recipe. The pastry should not be too rich. A good recipe has been given for pastry for <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and <ingredient>game</ingredient> pies; it should be about a quarter of an inch thick when it is placed on the pie, and should be protected with buttered paper until the last half-hour of baking.</p>

When no <ingredient>wine</ingredient> is used, a very little chopped <ingredient>onion</ingredient> is put into English <ingredient>venison</ingredient> pasties. If the <ingredient>venison</ingredient> is tender, the crust may be put on the pie at once; otherwise it is well to bake the <ingredient>venison</ingredient> for an hour before covering the pasty. Either use a bottom crust, or run a strip of pastry around the sides of the dish, and wet the edges to make the upper crust adhere. Make a groove in the top crust as shown in the picture; cut several slits to permit the escape of steam; brush the crust with beaten <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> and bake the pasty slowly for two hours.

At changing seasons, when the temperature is so variable, the keeping of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> becomes an important question to the housekeeper. There can be no better method than that employed by the old Pennsylvania Dutch housewives, when an animal was killed on the farm. After the portions of carcass suitable for salting were selected, and those chosen for immediate use set aside, the remainder was cut up in joints of available size, and either baked or roasted to the desired point,--rare, medium rare, or well done; stone jars or wooden tubs were selected to correspond with the size of the joints, a margin of about two inches in all directions being allowed. While the joints were being cooked, a large kettle of <ingredient>lard</ingredient> or <ingredient>drippings</ingredient> was melted. When the carcass was of <ingredient>pork,</ingredient> <ingredient>lard</ingredient> was made from the leaf; when of any other <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> the <ingredient>suet</ingredient> was rendered.

THE variety of salads depends solely upon the taste and ingenuity of the housekeeper, for the possibilities are illimitable. Those made of uncooked vegetables should always be fresh and crisp. If they are wilted in the least degree, they should be washed, without draining, and put into a cool, dark place to revive. Before using them, all decayed leaves should be removed, and the moisture absorbed from them by using a soft, clean towel. <ingredient>Cucumbers</ingredient> should be peeled, and laid in cold <ingredient>salted water</ingredient> for an hour before serving them, and then shaken dry in a clean towel, and dressed with <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> and plenty of good <ingredient>oil.</ingredient> <ingredient>Radishes</ingredient> should be similarly dressed. If they are very pungent in taste, a very little <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> will modify their sharpness. The young, <ingredient>white</ingredient> leaves of <ingredient>oyster-plant</ingredient>, mixed with an equal quantity of chopped <ingredient>green onions,</ingredient> both being well cleansed, make a good salad. <ingredient>Green peppers,</ingredient> chopped without the <ingredient>seeds,</ingredient> and added to <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> shaved fine, are excellent. <ingredient>Nasturtium leaves,</ingredient> stems, and buds, washed and chopped, dressed with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>oil,</ingredient> and <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> are very good; the flowers may be used to garnish the dish. All these salads should be dressed with the plain French salad-dressing. Enough for a medium-sized salad may be made by mixing thoroughly together a heaping saltspoonful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> half a level saltspoonful of <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> two tablespoonfuls of <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> and six of <ingredient>salad-oil.</ingredient></p>

<p><ingredient>Celery</ingredient> should be carefully washed in plenty of <ingredient>salted water;</ingredient> the green leaves and stalks trimmed off, and either used fresh for flavoring sauces, soups, and force-<ingredient>meats,</ingredient> or dried by gentle heat for later use; the roots should be peeled, dried, and then grated and mixed with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> for table use. The <ingredient>white stalks</ingredient> are best for the table; after they are washed, they may be kept in a cool, dark place, or in the refrigerator, near the ice. Frozen <ingredient>celery</ingredient> must be laid in plenty of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> as soon as it is brought into the house, and kept there until all the frost is extracted: thawing it by heat destroys its excellence.</p>



<p><ingredient>Lettuce</ingredient> should be kept on or near the ice after it is washed, or in a cool, dark place, entirely wrapped in a cloth wet in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient>: if it is enclosed in an air-tight box after it is wrapped in the wet cloth, it will keep fresh for some time, care being taken to renew the wet cloth, and trim off all defective leaves.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">MUSHROOMS.</purpose>







Many persons who like this excellent fungus are afraid to eat it because accidents have occurred from its use; but care will guard against such danger, both with fresh and canned <ingredient>mushrooms.</ingredient></p>



<p>There is no danger to be apprehended in using the canned <ingredient>mushrooms,</ingredient> if, when the can is opened, the <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> look clean and perfect, of a light buff color, without any dark or defective spots; the liquid in the can should be clear, that is, not thick, and slightly colored by the <ingredient>mushrooms.</ingredient> The interior of the cans should be bright and clean, not dark or rusted; if there is the slightest appearance of discoloration or <ingredient>verdigris</ingredient> on the inside of the can, or near any joint in the tin in the can, the <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> contained in it might prove injurious. So far as the <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> themselves are concerned, it is almost an impossibility for a poisonous one to be present in a can, because they are raised in so-called <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> caves or cellars, from <ingredient>seed</ingredient> or rather spawn, which is prepared from exhausted <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> beds: under these circumstances, it is almost impossible even for a poisonous <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> to spring in a bed; but if it did, its color, size, and general appearance would indicate its character, and it would at once be destroyed. The growers of <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> exercise a great care in the cultivation of the vegetable and 



 



<pb n="412" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=442"/>







in its preparation for the market. The few instances known of poisoning from the use of canned <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> have been traced to carelessness in their preparation; the cooking having been done in unclean utensils, or in copper vessels from which the tin lining is worn, or the cooked <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> have been allowed to stand over night in a metal vessel.</p>



<p>The fresh <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> which are brought to city markets are generally raised in <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> beds, by professional gardeners, who are perfectly conversant with all the characteristics of the vegetable; and so there is but little danger possible in using them. The fresh <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> sold during the summer and early fall in the markets are usually gathered in the fields and pastures by persons who know the varieties of fungi, and who discard all except the <emph rend="italic">agaricus campestris,</emph> or field <ingredient>mushroom.</ingredient></p>



<p>The fungi grow in form of a <emph rend="italic">pileus</emph> or cap, upon a short, stout stem, covered with a thin epidermis, and generally divided beneath into radiated gills, which are the <ingredient>seed-bearing</ingredient> organs. Form and appearance safely indicate the innocuous or harmful qualities of the <ingredient>mushrooms,</ingredient> but the test of tasting may be applied if one need be exercised. If a small part of the cap, eaten with a little <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> does not cause a burning or stinging sensation in the throat or stomach, and if the taste is pleasant and agreeable, the variety may be used. If this test shows the presence of a poisonous matter, by the burning sensation, the peril can be averted by a free use of <ingredient>common salt,</ingredient> followed by emetics and <ingredient>castor-oil.</ingredient> It should be remembered, that a perfectly good fungus, which is in excellent eating order when gathered, may decay and become unfit for food in a few hours; and therefore all species should be eaten or preserved when fresh. The most familiar of all the edible fungi is the agaric. With the best-known variety, the <emph rend="italic">agaricus campestris</emph> (the true meadow <ingredient>mushroom,</ingredient> or pink-gill), every lover of good dinners is acquainted,

as this is the <emph rend="italic">champignon</emph> cultivated extensively in Europe, and imported largely into this country in cans. It is often met with in our own markets. Its color is white, its gills pink when fresh, gradually turning brown after gathering. Its cap, from three to six inches in diameter, is plump and white, or cream-color, covered with a fine down; and its flesh is firm and <ingredient>white,</ingredient> with a pinkish tinge. The stem bears a well-defined white ring, which disappears as the <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> dries.</p>



<p>In bright, open, sunny pastures, the <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> disappear after the sun is high, and searchers for them seek their evanescent treasures early in the day: in more shaded localities, where there is much moisture, they sometimes grow until nightfall. In the <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> caves and in the gardeners' hotbeds, where they are sheltered from the direct rays and heat of the sun, they seem to last longer, and to attain a larger growth; but their flavor is less intense than that of the outdoor <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient>: there is almost as much difference in the flavor of cultivated and field-grown <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> as there is between the flavor of poultry and <ingredient>game-birds</ingredient>. However, during an experiment made in raising <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> in the cellar of a New-York house, specimens from two to six inches diameter in the cap, firm in texture, and of full, high flavor, were raised, some of them growing in the beds for two or three days: it may be mentioned here, that from one spot about the size of a man's hand, in the angle of the wall, a group was gathered which weighed a pound and a half.</p>



<p>At first the <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> appears as a tiny <ingredient>white</ingredient> knob, close to the ground; it quickly grows, the cap frequently being expanded in the morning and the decay complete by night, out of doors; the little white knob expands until the under side gradually opens, permitting the fringe-like gills to appear; as the cap breaks away from the stem, it leaves the rough ring where it joined the stem, and this gradually dries up. The gills are of a delicate pink, a sort of <ingredient>salmon-color</ingredient>; as 



 



<pb n="414" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=444"/>







the <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> grows, the color of the gills deepens gradually through the shades of brown, and finally, when the <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> is a day old, becomes quite black, and, as gradually, the substance of the <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> loses its first crisp, fleshy consistence, and becomes withered and fibrous; under favorable conditions of quick, dry, artificial heat, it slowly dries, ordinarily it decays. The flavor of the meadow <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> is sweet and nutty, while that of poisonous varieties is sharp and acrid. The poisonous <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> have not the characteristic pink gills of the harmless sort. A favorite popular test is to cook with the <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> a <ingredient>white onion</ingredient> peeled, or a silver spoon, and, if either turns black, to avoid the <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> as poisonous.</p>

When a cake-pan is too shallow for the quantity of cake desired, or when the cake is so light that it is likely to rise above the top of the pan, it can be kept in shape by using<pb n="450" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=480"/>

<p>It may not be amiss to reprint the following hints for the successful baking of cake:-</p>



<p>In baking cake, the greatest care should be taken to guard against too great heat in the oven; a layer of sand on the bottom of the oven, about half an inch thick, is a safeguard against burning on the bottom; if the general heat is too great, the cake will burn, or crack on the top, before it can bake properly; if the oven is not hot enough, the cake will not rise properly. A very safe test of the heat is to put a spoonful of the cake dough or batter on a bit of buttered paper, and slip it into the oven; this may be done during

the final mixing of the cake, so that it will not have to stand after it is ready for the oven; if the little cake bakes evenly and quickly, without burning at the edge, the heat is right, and the large cake may be put into the oven.

An <emph rend="italic">omelette souffl&#201;</emph> properly made is one of the most delicious of hot sweets.

Pastry forms such a large part of American so-called desserts, that it is fully illustrated and described; the pictures are copied from Gouff&#201;'s "Royal Confectionery Book;" and the method given is that of Car&#232;me, now followed by the best-trained masters of the art of cookery. A great deal of patience and considerable practice are required to reach the point of success with <ingredient>puff-paste,</ingredient> but it is usually thought worth all necessary labor. It should always be made in the coolest available place, and in the intervals of doing other kitchen work, or the process will seem long and tiresome.</p>



<p>For those who do not wish to undertake <ingredient>puff-paste,</ingredient> recipes are given for several easier and excellent pastries.</p>



</recipe>



<recipe class1="breadsweets">



<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">PUFF-PASTE.</purpose>







The following recipe is reproduced from the author's "Baltimore Recipes;" the cuts which illustrate the process are copied from Gouff&#201;'s "Royal Confectionery," as are many others in this volume. A smooth hard-wood roller, and a very thick hard-wood or stone pastry-slab are needed, the stone being preferable because it keeps the pastry cool. First wet the slab with a little <ingredient>water,</ingredient> lay upon it half a pound of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> work out all the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>buttermilk</ingredient> by kneading it with both hands, and then keep out about an ounce of <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> fold the rest in a <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed napkin, and lay it upon some ice. Second, dry the slab thoroughly, sift upon it half a pound of fine <ingredient>white flour,</ingredient> form this in a circle or well, as shown in the first cut, putting aside about two ounces to dust the slab with; into the well drop the ounce of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> reserved and the <ingredient>yolk of one egg,</ingredient> and work them to a <ingredient>cream</ingredient> with the tips of the fingers; to this gradually add the <ingredient>flour</ingredient>



<illustration><caption>Circle of Flour for Puff-Paste.</caption><description>An illustration of a circle of flour for puff-paste.</description></illustration>



 



<pb n="468" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=498"/>







from the well, with enough <ingredient>ice-cold water</ingredient> poured on from time to time as required to form a dough about the consistency of shortcake (about one cup of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> more or less, will be used, according to the body of the <ingredient>flour</ingredient>); now work the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> about on the slab until it leaves it clean and free, and does not cling to the fingers; take it up in a ball, and dust the slab slightly with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> lay on the <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> flatten it down, and beat it with the roller for five minutes, turning and doubling it constantly, or knead it like <ingredient>bread</ingredient> for five minutes. This process toughens it so that the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> will not break through in the subsequent manipulations. Third, raise the <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> and dust the slab again with <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> lay the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> on it, and roll out to a square of about eight inches; turn the face of the <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> or the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> which has been next the roller, down upon the slab, lay upon it the lump of <ingredient>cold butter,</ingredient> and fold the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> up and over it so as to cover every part; the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> may be enclosed in a square, as shown in the second cut, or the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> wrapped over it to form a ball; turn the ball thus formed upside down, roll it out gently and

<pb n="469" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=499"/>







evenly until the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is incorporated with the <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> taking care not to break through the latter, as all the air-cells that can be gathered unbroken in the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> assist its rising; now turn the sheet of <ingredient>paste</ingredient> gently about on the slab, so that every part may be rolled to the same thickness of about one-quarter

of an inch; in turning the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> lift its outer edge, and gently lap it over the roller toward you, being sure not to tear it; roll it gently inward, keeping it around the roller, and lifting it clear from the board when you wish to turn it, or change its position in any way; when you wish to replace it upon the slab, gently unwind it from the roller, letting the face or part next the roller fall upon the slab. Fourth, the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> is now ready for forming the flakes; to do this, turn the face down, fold it in three thicknesses lengthwise, making it three times as long as it is wide, as shown in the third cut; and then folding it again three times to make the square shown in the fourth cut; lay it in a long pan <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed, set this in a larger pan of ice, and place upon it a third pan filled with ice, so that the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> will be completely surrounded with ice; let the pan stand for five minutes in the <implement>ice-box,</implement> or in the

coolest place you can command, always bearing in mind that the <implement>cooler</implement> the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> is kept, the better it will be. Repeat the folding process described in the "fourth" part, six times in succession, every time setting the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> in ice for five minutes, every time turning the face of the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> with the folds down to the slab, and every time folding in an opposite direction, or the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> will lie at one side, and the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> will rise unevenly in baking. Fifth, to finish: After the sixth time of folding, roll the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> out to the thickness of one-quarter of an inch, and cut out in shape with a knife for pies, or for patties with a sharp <implement>tin cutter</implement> of the size required, marking in the centre of each patty a circle an inch in diameter with a small <implement>pastry-cutter.</implement> For small tarts or patties have the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> one-quarter of an inch thick; for large ones, or <emph rend="italic">vol-au-vents,</emph> have it about one-third thicker; for patties, use two layers of <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> put one over the other after cutting out, and wet the under layer with a soft brush dipped in <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> brush the top of the second layer with an <ingredient>egg</ingredient> beaten up; this is called <emph rend="italic">dor&#201;e,</emph> or gilding, and the process gives the pastry a beautiful golden blaze. In forming <emph rend="italic">vol-au-vents</emph> or large pastries, use three or even four thicknesses of the <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> putting them together as for patties, brushing the under layers with <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and gilding the top. Sixth, and lastly, wet the <implement>baking-pan</implement> with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> instead of greasing it, lay the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> upon it, set it for five minutes upon the ice in order that the layers may adhere, and put in a moderate oven five minutes so that all the air-cells will have a chance to expand; then finish at a heat of about 300 degrees Fahrenheit, and be sure that the patties are done before taking them from the oven, or they will fall.</p>

The secret of success in making pastry is to work quickly in a cool room, and to keep the pastry as cold as possible. Even in making plain pastry, only the best <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter</ingredient> should be used; the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> should be freshly sifted, and the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> worked with the hands in plenty of <ingredient>ice-water</ingredient> until it assumes a waxy appearance and touch; if it is worked quickly and lightly, it will not stick to the hands; when the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is of the proper consistency, it should be patted with the hands into a cake about an inch thick, wrapped in a <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed towel, and put in a dish set on ice in summer, or out of doors in winter, so that it may become quite cold while the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> is being prepared; allow half a pound of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> to a pound of <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> After the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> is sifted, mix with it a teaspoonful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and with a sharp knife chop into it one-third of the <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> then quickly mix with it enough <ingredient>ice-water</ingredient> to make a dough which does not stick to the hands; the mixing may be done with the knife or the hand, but it

At the end of an hour put in with the <ingredient>tongue</ingredient> three pounds of <ingredient>lean beef</ingredient> cut from the <ingredient>neck</ingredient> or round, add a tablespoonful of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> to the pot-liquor, and continue the boiling by a very gentle heat for three hours longer; then uncover the pot, set it off the fire, take out the <ingredient>tongue</ingredient> and <ingredient>skin</ingredient> it, and then return it to the pot, and let both <ingredient>tongue</ingredient> and <ingredient>beef</ingredient> cool in the pot-liquor.</p>



<p>When the <ingredient>tongue</ingredient> and <ingredient>beef</ingredient> are cold, free the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> from all <ingredient>skin</ingredient> and gristle, and chop it fine.

The variety of hot and cold breads is very great; only specimens of different kinds can be given here, for there are enough to fill a large volume of American breads alone. Many breakfast and luncheon breads are included in this chapter. The dinner <ingredient>bread</ingredient> proper is a rather thick slice, or square piece, of <ingredient>white bread</ingredient> laid upon the napkin. French dinner <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is baked in a long roll so that there shall be plenty of crust. Of the fried cakes, only the fritters are suitable for dinners; they are in place among the <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;es,</emph> but often take the place of dessert at informal family dinners. The waffles are special breakfast and supper cakes, and the griddle-cakes are generally used at breakfast.</p>

These two <ingredient>bread</ingredient> recipes, like several others in this volume, are reproduced from the author's Baltimore Recipes, because the formulas have stood the test of several years' trial in the school of cookery.</p>



<p>Two methods are given, with personal preference for the <ingredient>compressed-yeast bread,</ingredient> because it is the quickest, and best <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> the nutriment of the <ingredient>flour.</ingredient></p>



<p>To make <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> boil two ounces of <ingredient>hops</ingredient> in two quarts of <ingredient>water</ingredient> for half an hour; strain the liquid, and cool it until it

<p>To make <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> put seven pounds of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> in a deep wooden bowl; in the centre of it put a tablespoonful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> a teaspoonful of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> a gill of <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> and sufficient <ingredient>lukewarm water</ingredient> to make a soft dough (about three pints); mix these ingredients with the hands until they form a smooth, shining dough; if necessary, use a little extra <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> only enough to facilitate the working of the dough; <ingredient>flour</ingredient> the bowl on the bottom and sides, so that the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> will not stick to it, cover it with a thick towel folded several times, set it in a warm place protected from draughts, and let it rise over night. In the morning knead the dough fifteen minutes, divide it into four loaves, put them into <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed <implement>baking-pans,</implement> cover them with a folded towel, and set them in a warm place to rise twice their height; when they are so risen, prick them at the sides with a fork, and bake them in a moderate oven until a knitting or <implement>trussing needle</implement> can be run into them without being made sticky. Be sure that they are well done, but do not let them burn.</p>

When it is possible to obtain fresh compressed <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> also called German <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> an excellent <ingredient>bread</ingredient> can be made in about two hours and a half; the rapidity of the leavening or "raising" the dough is advantageous, because less of the nutritive elements of the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> are lost than by following the long process. For two loaves of <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> use three pounds of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> about a quart of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> two teaspoonfuls of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and

<p>In raising the sponge, be sure that the heat is not sufficient to "scald" or harden it, as that will prevent fermentation; therefore do not place it where the hand cannot be held with comfort; keep it covered from draughts. If when it is light it has become at all soured, as it sometimes will in summer, stir into it, before adding the balance of the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> a saltspoonful of baking-<ingredient>soda</ingredient> dissolved in a very little <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p>



<p>The dough made for home-made <ingredient>bread</ingredient> can be baked as raised <ingredient>biscuit</ingredient> by kneading in with it a little <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and melted <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> or it can be boiled in soups and stews as raised dumplings.</p>



<p>To test the heat of the oven, follow the method of Jules Gouff&#201;, the celebrated <emph rend="italic">chef</emph> of the Paris Jockey Club: the "moderate oven" temperature is that degree of heat which will turn ordinary writing-paper dark yellow or buff, that is, the color of kindling-wood; put a sheet of paper in the oven, and close the door; if the paper blazes, the oven is too hot; arrange the dampers to lower the heat for ten minutes, then again test it with more paper; it may be necessary to try the temperature several times, but the time thus used is well spent.</p>

The secret of making good ice-cream of any grade lies in the freezing. The old way of freezing <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> which is still in use among small confectioners, consisted of occasionally stirring the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> while it was freezing in a tin can set in a tub of ice and <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> A more easy and expeditious method is within the reach of the average housekeeper in these days of patent freezers. The same principle underlies all the best known patents; i.e., the mixing of the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> by a wooden beater which revolves inside the can by the same motion that slightly changes the position of the can in the outer tub of ice and <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> This freezing-mixture should be composed of three parts of crushed ice to one of <ingredient>coarse salt,</ingredient> and care should be taken that it does not reach high enough around the sides of the can to penetrate to the interior, and so spoil the <ingredient>cream;</ingredient> the <ingredient>water</ingredient> formed in the outer tub by the melting of the freezing mixture need not be drawn off while the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is being frozen, unless it is likely to get into the

can, because the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is intensely cold. If it is desired to pack the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> after it is frozen, the <ingredient>water</ingredient> may be drawn off, and enough more ice and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> packed around the can to nearly reach to the top. Ice-cream packed in this way can be kept over night, or longer if the freezing mixture is properly renewed. When ice-cream is "moulded," or packed in tin moulds of fancy shapes, all the openings should be closed with <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> or oiled paper closed about the apertures of the mould with <ingredient>paste</ingredient> or <ingredient>gum-tragacanth</ingredient>.</p>



<p>Ice-creams of the most ordinary sort are made of <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> thickened with <ingredient>arrowroot</ingredient> or <ingredient>corn-starch</ingredient> in the proportion of a tablespoonful to a quart, dissolved in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and then boiled in the <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> which is cooled, sweetened, and flavored before it is frozen.</p>

This delicious <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> is of late years so abundant and cheap that it well deserves the attention of good housekeepers. It is an excellent dessert <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> and, if quite ripe, is far less unwholesome than is generally supposed. As served usually, it is peeled, sliced, and sugared before it is sent to the table; but more of its flavor and <ingredient>juice</ingredient> are preserved if it is served with the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> on, in English fashion, or in West-<ingredient>Indian</ingredient> style, as directed below; either way it can easily be handled, for a knife and fork are always required to cut it readily, a teaspoon being quite inadequate for that purpose. Perfectly ripe <ingredient>pineapples</ingredient> do not really require <ingredient>sugar;</ingredient> but as many prefer to use it, it is well to place a dish of <ingredient>powdered sugar</ingredient> on the table with the <ingredient>fruit.</ingredient> The beauty of the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> is in its shape and color, and these are lost if it is entirely cut up before being served. In England, where <ingredient>pineapples</ingredient> are always the greatest luxuries, they are cut in horizontal slices with a very sharp, thin-bladed knife, the slices being kept together, and the crown being left on the <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> which is placed in the centre of a dish of assorted <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> as the chief ornament of the dessert. The <ingredient>pineapple</ingredient> can also be cut from the crown to the base in wedge-shaped slices, the middle being left just entire enough to hold the slices in place until they are needed for serving; they can then be readily dislodged with a thin, sharp knife, and served with a silver knife and fork.</p>
