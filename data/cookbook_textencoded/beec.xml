<purpose align="center" rend="italic">Directions for freezing Ice Cream.</purpose>



If you have no apparatus for the purpose (which is <emph rend="italic">almost</emph> indispensable), put the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> into a tin pail with a very tight cover, mix equal quantities of <ingredient>snow</ingredient> and <ingredient>blown salt</ingredient> (not the coarse salt), or of <ingredient>pounded ice</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> in a tub, and put it <emph rend="italic">as high as the pail, or freezer;</emph> turn the pail or freezer half round and back again with one hand, for half an hour, or longer, if you want it very nice. Three quarters of an hour steadily, will make it good enough. While doing this, stop four or five times, and mix the frozen part with the rest, the last time very thoroughly, and then the <ingredient>lemon juice</ingredient> must be put in. Then cover the freezer tight with snow and salt till it is wanted. The mixture must be perfectly cool before being put in the freezer. Renew the snow and salt while shaking, so as to have it kept tight to the sides of the freezer. A hole in the tub holding the freezing mixture to let off the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> is a great advantage. In a tin pail it would take much longer to freeze than in the freezer, probably nearly twice as long, or one hour and a half. A long stick, like a <implement>coffee stick,</implement> should be used in scraping the ice from the sides. Iron spoons will be affected by the lemon juice, and give a bad taste.</p><p>In taking it out for use, first wipe off every particle of the freezing mixture dry, then with a knife loosen the sides, then invert the freezer upon the dish in which the <ingredient>ice</ingredient> is to be served, and apply two towels rung out of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> to the bottom part, and the whole will slide out in the shape of a cylinder.</p><p>If you wish to put it into moulds, pour it into them when the cream is frozen sufficiently, and then cover the moulds in the snow and salt till they are wanted. Dip the moulds in <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> to make the ice slip out easily.</p><p>If you wish to have a freezer made, send the following directions to a tinner.</p><p>Make a tin cylinder box, eighteen inches high and eight inches in diameter at the bottom, and a trifle larger at the top, so that the frozen cream will slip out easier<pb n="167" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=192"/>Have a cover made with a rim to lap over three inches, and fitted tight. Let there be a round handle fastened to the lid, an inch in diameter, and reaching nearly across, to take hold of, to stir the cream. This will cost from fifty to seventy-five cents.</p><p>The tub holding the ice and freezer should have a hole in the bottom, to let the water run off, and through the whole process the ice must be close packed the whole depth of the freezer.</p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" rend="italic">Directions for making Butter.</purpose>



Two particulars are indispensable to success in making <emph rend="italic">good</emph> <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> the first is, that the churning be frequent, so that the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> will not grow bitter, or sour; and the second is <emph rend="italic">cleanliness</emph> in all the implements an processes connected with it.</p><p><variation>In hot weather it is important to keep the <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> cream, and butter as cool as possible. For this purpose, those who have no ice-house, or very cool milk-room, hang their cream down a well. In winter it is needful to raise the temperature of the cream a little, while churning, but care must be taken to do it very slightly, or the butter is injured. The best way is to warm the <implement>churn,</implement> and churn in a warm room.</variation></p><p><variation>After the weather gets cold, the cream rises more perfectly after allowing the milk to stand say ten or eleven hours, to set it over a furnace a while till it is warmed through, but not heated hot enough to boil. Then take it back, let it stand eleven hours longer, and skim it. This secures more, and better cream.</variation></p><p><variation>In hot weather, set the <implement>churn</implement> into a tub of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and churn steadily, as stopping puts back the process, and injures the butter. In hot weather, do not churn very fast, as it makes soft butter.</variation> When the butter has come, collect it in a wooden bowl, which is the best article to work it in, having first scalded it, and then put it in cold water till cold. <emph rend="italic">Do not use the hand</emph> in working over butter, as it injures it so much that a higher<pb n="207" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=232"/>price is often paid for butter made without using the hand.</p><p>A wooden spad made for the purpose is the proper article for working over butter.</p><p>As soon as the butter is put in the bowl, pour in as much of the <ingredient>coldest water</ingredient> as will allow you to work the butter, and keep adding and pouring off cold water, as you work it, until the <ingredient>water</ingredient> will run off clear. It is continuing this process until <emph rend="italic">all</emph> the <ingredient>buttermilk</ingredient> is extracted, which alone will secure butter that will keep good and sweet. Water hastens the process, but butter keeps longer not to have it used.</p><p>No precise direction can be given for salting, as tastes vary so much in regard to this. It is a good way to notice the proportions which are most agreeable, and note the measure, and then measure ever after.</p><p>In salting down in <implement>firkins,</implement> use the nicest <ingredient>rock salt,</ingredient> as much depends on the nature of the <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> The <implement>firkins</implement> must be very thoroughly seasoned, and the bottom covered with salt, and the sides rubbed with it. Pack the butter in layers, with salt between. After a few days, the butter will shrink from the sides, and then the space must be filled with new and nice brine. Muslin spread under and over the layer of salt, between the layers of butter is a good plan, as it saves the butter.</p><p>It is said that butter will be preserved sweet a long time for journeys, or voyages, by working into it very thoroughly a mixture composed of one-fourth salt, one-fourth <ingredient>saltpetre,</ingredient> and two-fourths <ingredient>white sugar.</ingredient></p><p>In large dairies, the milk is churned soon after it is taken from the cow.</p><p>The quality of butter depends very much upon the kind of cows. Those who give a great deal of milk, are usually small and thin. Every cow should have a tea-cup full of salt each week, and must be well fed. Green cornstalks and carrots, are excellent for cows. Turnips, cabbage, and parsnips spoil the milk. The waste of the kitchen, with a quart of corn meal, and as much hay as she will eat daily, is good fare. Skimmed milk for drink is good, and if it is refused, withhold water, and<pb n="208" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=233"/>the cow will learn to love it. Milk three times a day, and you get much more cream; stripping must be done thoroughly, or you lose cream, and dry up the cow. Never make a cow run, as it injures the milk. Use tin vessels for milk.</p><p>A <implement>stoneware churn</implement> is best, and a tin one is better than wood. Keep milk in a cool place, where air circulates freely; close air spoils milk and cream. Never stir milk after it is set, as it stops the rising of the cream. Skim milk as soon as it becomes <emph rend="italic">loppard.</emph> Put a little <ingredient>ice</ingredient> in each pan in hot weather, and you get more cream. In skimming milk, do not scrape off the hardest portion that adheres to the pan, as it injures the butter. Put a spoonful of salt to each pailful of milk (except what is for family use), and it makes the butter sweeter, and come easier. Salt your cream as you gather it, and it keeps better, and makes sweeter butter. In hot weather churn in the coolest part of the day, and in a cool place, and do not shut the air out of the <implement>churn,</implement> as it is necessary to make the butter come. Butter is best, to work it enough the first time. Never work it three times. It will keep better to work out the buttermilk without putting in water. The more entirely it is freed from buttermilk, the longer it will keep sweet.</p><p><variation><purpose>A good brine is made for butter</purpose> by dissolving a quart of <ingredient>fine salt,</ingredient> a pound of <ingredient>loaf sugar,</ingredient> and a teaspoonful of saltpetre in two quarts of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and then strain it on to the butter.</variation> Packed butter is most perfectly preserved sweet by setting the <implement>firkin</implement> into a larger <implement>firkin,</implement> and filling in with good brine, and covering it. Butter will keep sweet a year thus.</p><p>Buttermilk kept in potter's ware dissolves the glazing, and becomes poisonous.</p><p>Never scald strainers or milky vessels till thoroughly washed, as the milk or cream put in them will be injured by it. The best way to scald such vessels is to plunge them all over into <ingredient>scalding water,</ingredient> and then every spot is scalded.</p><p>Butter will sometimes not come because the air is too much excluded from the <implement>churn.</implement></p></recipe></chapter>

<purpose align="center" rend="italic">Best Way of making Corn Cakes of all Sorts.</purpose>



There is often a sharp and strong taste to <ingredient>corn meal,</ingredient> which is remedied by wetting it up the day before it is used. The best kind of corn cakes are made by wetting up a large quantity of <ingredient>Indian meal</ingredient> with <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> and letting it stand for several days. Take a quantity of it, and first make it as thin as you want, either for griddle cakes, or drop cakes, or thicker cakes. Add <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and a spoonful of <ingredient>melted butter or lard</ingredient> for every quart, also <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> to your taste. A little always improves all corn cakes. Then dissolve <ingredient>soda or saleratus,</ingredient> a teaspoonful for each quart. If it is very sour it will want more, and <emph rend="italic">tasting</emph> is the surest guide. Just as you are ready to bake, stir in enough saleratus to sweeten it, and stir quickly and only long enough to mix it well, and then <emph rend="italic">bake immediately</emph> in buttered tins.</p><p>Domestics often use too much saleratus, which is bad for the stomach, and the housekeeper should ascertain by trial the right quantity, and then direct to have it <emph rend="italic">carefully measured</emph> every time. Corn cakes, made as above, just thick enough to form into round cakes half an inch thick and baked on a griddle, are excellent.</p></recipe>
