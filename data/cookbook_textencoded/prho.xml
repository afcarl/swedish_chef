Take a knuckle of ham, perfectly sweet, a knuckle of veal, and



about six pounds of flank of beef, which put into a pan, with an



onion stuck with two cloves, a few carrots, &#38;c.; pour



over the above two ladles of broth, and let the whole sweat over a slow



fire. When the meat is done through the middle, cover it entirely with



boiling broth, and let the whole stew for three hours. Then take one or



more cabbages, which are to be washed clean and blanched. Braise them between



layers of bacon, and moisten them with the liquor in which the sweating



has been made, strained through a silk sieve. You must observe that, if the



cabbages are not made rich and mellow, they are good for nothing. Add to the



above, either sausages, bacon, or stewed legs of geese:



mind above all things that the cabbage be not too briny, for the soup



then would not be eatable. When the cabbage and broth are stewed



enough, cut very thin slices of rye-bread: drain the cabbage in a



cloth, so that there be no fat left, then take a large deep silver dish,



lay a bed of bread, and over that one of cabbage, and moisten



them with a little broth; let them stew on a slow fire. When the



cabbage and bread are sufficiently moistened, lay on six or eight



beds more of each, and let it simmer on the stove till the bottom of the dish



is gratined, as what sticks to the bottom of the dish is most tasty and



palatable.<pb n="177" id="prho183.gif"/> Send up with the ham on the

very useful in cookery, and will be often referred to in these receipts. This



process will take ten minutes, when remove from the fire for two minutes to



cool; then add at once three pints and a quarter of the above stock;

<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">1042.--POTATOES</purpose>Require no attention for the preservation of their <emph rend="italic">color,</emph> but their <emph rend="italic">flavor</emph> will be spoiled if their dressing be not attended to, which, although of the most simple nature, is frequently ill performed. The best mode of doing it is to sort the <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> and choose them of an equal size; wash them with a scrubbing-brush, and put them into <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> sufficient to cover them, and no more. About ten minutes after the <ingredient>water</ingredient> has come to a boil, take out the half of it, and replace with <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> to check it; the reason assigned for which is, "that the <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> sends the heat from the surface to the <ingredient>heart,</ingredient> and makes the <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> mealy." Then throw in a large: handful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient>



leave the pot uncovered, and let it remain upon the fire to simmer until the <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> are done; this is the moment to be watched, for if overboiled, they will become waxy. The cook should, therefore, occasionally try them, by piercing them to the <ingredient>heart</ingredient> with a fork, and, when they are tender, the pot should be instantly taken off the fire, and the <ingredient>potatoes </ingredient> passed through a colander to drain; which being done, and the <ingredient>water</ingredient> thrown out, they should then be replaced upon a folded flannel, in the same pot, which should be left by the side of the fire to keep hot and to cause the evaporation of the



steam. When served, they should be wrapped in a warmed cotton napkin. If of moderate size they will take about half an hour boiling, to which fifteen minutes must be added for evaporation, ere they can be sent to table.</p><illustration><caption>Potato Steamer and Saucepan.</caption><description>An illustration of a potator steamer and saucepan.</description>



</illustration><p>An iron pot is the best vessel for boiling <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> in, since, after the <ingredient>water</ingredient> has been poured off, it retains sufficient heat to dry them thoroughly.</p>







<p>A good and economical mode of dressing <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> when soup, <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> or other eatables are to be boiled, is to have a tin strainer fitted to the mouth of the saucepan, so as to allow the steam to ascend from the boiler.</p>







<p>Notwithstanding the directions here given for <emph rend="italic">cooking <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient></emph> there is a point, on which there exists a difference of opinion, that is <emph rend="italic">respecting the peeling</emph> of the roots, whether <emph rend="italic">before</emph> or <emph rend="italic">after</emph> their being boiled?</p>



 



<p>In Lancashire, England, where they are largely grown and admirably boiled, they are first peeled; while in Ireland they are invariably brought to table "with their jackets on."

</recipe>



<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans">







<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">1114.--SALADS.</purpose>







Coss-<ingredient>lettuce</ingredient> and blanched endive make the best salad, the green leaves being stripped off, and leaving nothing but the close, <ingredient>white hearts,</ingredient> which, after being washed and placed for an hour or two in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> should be wiped quite dry. To this should be added a <ingredient>head</ingredient> or two of <ingredient>celery,</ingredient> a couple of



<ingredient>anchovies</ingredient> (which are far preferable to the essence), and several <ingredient>chives,</ingredient> or young <ingredient>onions,</ingredient> all cut small, while the lettuces should



be di vided lengthwise into quarters, and cut into rather large pieces.</p>







<p><emph rend="italic">The mixture or dressing.</emph>--For four persons bruise only the <ingredient>yolk</ingredient> of one <ingredient>hard-boiled egg</ingredient> (leaving out altogether the <ingredient>white</ingredient>), with some <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> arid make it into a <ingredient>paste</ingredient> with two large teaspoonfuls of 



<emph rend="italic">mo&#251;tarde de maille;</emph> or, if obliged to use common <ingredient>mustard,</ingredient> add to it a drop or two of asafoetida, which will impart to it a slight flavor of <ingredient>garlic.</ingredient> Then add <ingredient>oil</ingredient> and <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> in the following proportions, without using so much as to make the <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> thin, and taking care to have the finest Provence or Lucca <ingredient>oil,</ingredient> and the very strongest species of real <ingredient>French vinegar</ingredient>: namely, to every <emph rend="italic">one</emph> spoonful of <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> add <emph rend="italic">two</emph> of <ingredient>oil;</ingredient> one spoonful of the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> being impregnated with <ingredient>chilis,</ingredient> which will add warmth to the salad, much more agreeably than cayenne. A little <ingredient>tarragon</ingredient> may be an improvement, and a spoonful of Quihi or <ingredient>walnut ketchup</ingredient> is not objectionable; but <ingredient>mushroom ketchup</ingredient> will destroy the pun gency of flavor, and both may be left out without inconvenience.</p>







<p>When this is done, mix the <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> well, but lightly, with the salad, to which a few slices of boiled <ingredient>beet-root,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>white of the egg</ingredient> sliced, will be a pretty addition.</p>







<p>The excellence of a salad consists in the vegetables being young and fresh, and they should be prepared only a short







<pb n="391" id="prho397.gif"/>







time before they are wanted; the salad mixture being either poured into the bottom of the bowl or sent up in a saucetureen, and not stirred up with the vege tables until they are served.</p>







<p>In summer salads the mixture must not be poured upon the <ingredient>lettuce</ingredient> or vege tables used in the salad, but be left at the bottom, to be stirred up when want ed, as thus preserving the crispness of the <ingredient>lettuce.</ingredient></p>







<p>In winter salads, however, the reverse of this proceeding must be adopted, as thus: the salad of endive, <ingredient>celery,</ingredient> <ingredient>beet,</ingredient> and other roots being cut ready for dress ing, then pour the mixture upon the in gredients, and stir them well up, so that every portion may receive its benefit.</p>







<p>In doing this, it should likewise be re collected that the spoon and fork should always be of wood, and of sufficient size to stir up the vegetables in large quantities. <ref target="n14">*</ref></p>

<p>An adept in pastry never leaves any part of it adhering to the board or dish



used in making. The best thing to make it upon is a slab of marble or slate;



which substances cause less waste, being cold and smooth. The coolest part of



the house, and of the day, should be chosen for the process; the hands should

much.</p>



<p>In whatever way <ingredient>paste</ingredient> be made, wetting it much will render it

<p><ingredient>Salt butter</ingredient> of the best quality makes a fine flaky crust; for sweet

<p>



<emph rend="italic">Raised pies</emph> must be put into a quick oven, or the

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">1303.--PUDDINGS.</purpose>There



are two different sorts of <ingredient>paste</ingredient> for puddings, one for 



<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>meat</ingredient></emph> and the other for 



<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>fruit</ingredient></emph>.</p>



<p>



<emph rend="italic">For <ingredient>Meat</ingredient> Pudding</emph>.--To one pound of



<ingredient>flour</ingredient> add eight ounces of finely chopped <ingredient>beef-suet</ingredient> cut from the



<ingredient>kidney.</ingredient> Mix it with <ingredient>water</ingredient> but do not wet it too much: after



mixing it well together with a wooden spoon, roll out the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> and put



in the <ingredient>meat;</ingredient> then close it; boil it in a cloth which has been



<ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed, tie it up, but leave sufficient room to permit the swelling of



the <ingredient>paste.</ingredient> <ingredient>Veal-suet</ingredient> may also be used, but that of <ingredient>beef</ingredient> is



better; or a mixture of both is not bad. If puddings be boiled in shapes, the



crust is not near so light.</p>



<p>



<emph rend="italic">For <ingredient>Fruit</ingredient> Puddings</emph> the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> should be



made as for a pie--using 



<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>butter</ingredient></emph> instead of 



<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>suet</ingredient></emph>; but unless for the sake of ap pearance,



they should never be boiled in shapes. A very little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> added to all



<ingredient>paste</ingredient> much improves it.</p>



<p>



<emph rend="italic">Sweet Pudding</emph>.--Very good puddings may be made 



<emph rend="italic">without <ingredient>eggs</ingredient></emph>; but they should have very



little liquid added to them, and must boil longer than puddings 



<emph rend="italic">with <ingredient>eggs</ingredient></emph>. A spoonful of <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> will



serve instead of two <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> and a pinch of <ingredient>soda</ingredient> will make it still



lighter. Two large spoonfuls of snow will supply the place of one <ingredient>egg,</ingredient>



and make a pudding equally good. This is a useful piece of information, as snow



generally falls in the season when <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> are dear. The sooner it is used



after it falls the better; but it may be taken up from a clean spot, and kept



in a cool place some hours, without losing its good qualities. Bottled



malt-liquors are also a good substitute for <ingredient>eggs;</ingredient> the sooner used after



the cork is drawn the better. <ingredient>Eggs</ingredient> should always be broken separately



into a cup before they are thrown together, as a single bad one might occasion



the loss of a great many without this precaution: the <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> and



<ingredient>whites,</ingredient> beaten long and separately, make the article they are put into



much lighter. They must always be strained after beating.</p>



<p>To avoid repetition, let it be observed that, when 



<emph rend="italic">pudding <ingredient>sauce</ingredient></emph> is ordered, <ingredient>wine,</ingredient>



<ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and very thick melted but ter, boiled up together, is the



<ingredient>sauce</ingredient> in tended.</p>



<p>If the pudding be partly of <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> the cloth should be tied so as to







allow for swelling; if of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> rather more tight.</p>



<p>Basins or forms are much better in ap pearance than cloths for boiling



puddings, but it makes them far less light.</p>



<p>The <ingredient>water</ingredient> should boil quickly, when the pudding is put in, and care



taken that it continues to do so, or the pudding<pb n="437" id="phro442.gif"/>



will be heavy; and it should be moved about for a minute or two, that the in



gredients may not separate.</p>



<p>All dishes in which puddings are baked should be lined with <ingredient>paste</ingredient> an



inch or two below the edge, as well as on it; the dish must be first rubbed



with <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> If a pudding is to be turned out from a mould, it must be



entirely lined with <ingredient>paste.</ingredient></p>



<p>The ingredients of puddings should not be put into the basin or dish till



the minute they go into the <ingredient>water</ingredient> or oven.</p>



<p>



<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>Sago,</ingredient></emph> and 



<emph rend="italic">all sorts of <ingredient>seeds,</ingredient></emph> should lie in



<ingredient>water</ingredient> an hour before they are made into puddings, and be well washed;



the want of this caution causes an earthy taste.</p>



<p>If the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> be strong that is used in puddings, they will not taste



well, whatever good things are added.</p>



<p>A small pinch of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> improves the flavor of all mixtures, even when



the other ingredients are sweet.</p>



<p>Well-made <ingredient>raisin</ingredient> or Cape <ingredient>wine</ingredient> will serve in most cases, when



<ingredient>wine</ingredient> is order ed for puddings.</p>



<p>As the goodness of boiled puddings greatly depends upon keeping the



ingredients closely but not too compactly together, the cook should take care



to have moulds and basins in readiness that will exactly hold the quantity



directed.</p>



<p>Puddings of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> or <ingredient>flour</ingredient> are much better if all the



ingredients be mixed (except the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient>) three hours before boiling or



baking; and they should be well stirred just before they are put into the oven



or saucepan.</p>



<p><ingredient>Plum</ingredient>-puddings are best boiled in a stout cloth well <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed;



care should be taken that it does not burn to the bottom of the kettle; to



prevent this put a plate at the bottom. When the pudding is of a large size it



is best to mix all but the liquid ingredients the day before it is boiled.</p>



<p>When <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is ordered to be put warm into puddings, the addition of



a little <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>wine</ingredient> will prevent its oiling.</p>



<p>



<emph rend="italic">Custard Puddings</emph> to look well should 



<emph rend="italic">simmer</emph> only, but without stopping. If boiled in a



quick or careless manner the surface will not be smooth, but have little holes



like honey-comb all over it. A sheet of writing-<ingredient>paper,</ingredient> thickly buttered,



should be put on the top of the mould before the lid or cloth is put on. and



the pudding should stand in the mould five minutes after being lifted from the



<ingredient>water.</ingredient> Many persons prefer their puddings steamed, but when this is not



done they should be put into plenty of <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> and kept well



covered.</p>



<p>Half an hour should be allowed for boiling a 



<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>bread</ingredient>-pudding</emph> in a half-pint basin, and so on



in proportion; but pud dings made up with half a pound of <ingredient>suet</ingredient> and any

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">1411.--OMELETTE.</purpose>This



is the most usual mode of dressing <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> after that of boiling them in

<p>Four <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> will make a very pretty sized omelet, but the number must



of course depend on the size required. If <ingredient>sweet herbs</ingredient> be put in, a good



deal of <ingredient>parsley</ingredient> should form part; <ingredient>tarragon</ingredient> gives a high flavor,



and <ingredient>chives</ingredient> or shalots are not unfrequently<pb n="461" id="prho466.gif"/>



used, but care should be taken that the flavor should not overpower that of the



other ingredients.</p>



<p>Omelets are judiciously varied by mixing grated <ingredient>ham</ingredient> or <ingredient>tongue</ingredient>



with minced <ingredient>anchovies,</ingredient> when served at supper or as a side-dish at



dinner; but when intended for the breakfast-table, it is more delicate to make



them of <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> alone.</p>



<p>Although a common frying-pan may be used, yet one made on purpose, not



larger than the size of a dessert-plate, should be employed, so as not to allow



the omelet too much spreading, for it should always be kept of a certain degree



of thickness to secure the softness of the inside. It is therefore only to be



fried on one side, and when the under is browned and the upper brought to a



moderate state of consistence, the fried side is to be folded over the other in



three.</p>



<p><ingredient>Butter</ingredient> is better than either <ingredient>lard</ingredient> or dripping for the frying



of an omelet. Any sort of pot-<ingredient>herbs</ingredient> is admissible; and many sorts of



minced <ingredient>fowl</ingredient> and <ingredient>fish</ingredient> are prepared in that manner. There are

with one pound of dry and sifted loaf-sugar, three pounds of



currants washed and very dry, half a pound of raisins stoned and



chopped, one-quarter of an ounce each of mace, cloves, and

quarter pint of cream, but not hot; put to it one pint of sweet



wine, a glass of brandy and another of rose-water, with the



whites and yolks of twelve eggs beaten apart, and half a pint of



good yeast. Strain this liquor by degrees into the dry ingredients,



beating them to gether a full hour; then butter the hoop or pan, and



bake it in a moderate oven for at least four hours. As you put in the batter,



throw in plenty of citron, lemon, and orange candy.</p>



<p>If you ice the cake, when it is nearly cold pour the icing over, and return



it to the oven, where it should be left all night, or until it becomes cold;



but if the oven be warm, keep it near the mouth, and the door open, lest the



color be spoiled; or the icing may be left until the next morning.</p>
