<purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO COOK AND SERVE TOMATOES</purpose>



No product of the vegetable garden in the whole circuit of the year is more amenable to skill in cookery than the tomato. Perhaps no other is capable of appearing in so great a variety of palatable and satisfying dishes. It combines admirably with other ingredients in a wide range, making it one of the best subjects for experiment and practice in high grade cooking that we possess. No single vegetable can be made of more use in furnishing a liberal and elegant table. Let us now consider some of these <pb n="39" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=cclu&#38;PageNum=79"/> uses, both of the usual and the more uncommon forms of serving it.</p><p>In the important matter of the family table, that true economy which consists of the best use of material to gain the desired end is greatly furthered by ingenuity in providing variety without extra expense. Here the skill of the cook has its actual money value; and no good housekeeper forgets that "money saved is money earned."</p><p><variation>



<purpose>TOMATO SOUPS</purpose>



.--Either with or without <ingredient>meat stock,</ingredient> an excellent soup is easily made from <ingredient>tomatoes.</ingredient> A savory bisque requires only the quart or more of sliced tomatoes, stewed until tender with a little <ingredient>water,</ingredient> then pressed through a sieve and mixed with a pint of <ingredient>rich milk</ingredient> (an added cupful of <ingredient>cream</ingredient> improves it) slightly thickened by rubbing together two tablespoonfuls of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> with two of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and cooking smoothly with the milk. Season to taste; a little <ingredient>cayenne</ingredient> is desirable, some will like a spoonful of <ingredient>onion juice,</ingredient> or <ingredient>celery salt</ingredient> may be preferred. Serve very hot, with <ingredient>crackers</ingredient> or <ingredient>croutons</ingredient>. For this and for most tomato soups, canned tomato may be substituted for the fresh fruit.</variation></p><p><variation>A soup stock of <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> <ingredient>mutton,</ingredient> <ingredient>lamb,</ingredient> <ingredient>veal</ingredient> or <ingredient>chicken</ingredient> makes a basis for a somewhat richer soup, and this is a convenient way of using remnants not otherwise available. Simmer the tomato slowly in the stock, coming in proportions to suit according to its richness. A weak stock may be re-enforced by a quart of tomato to a quart of <ingredient>stock</ingredient>, and a <ingredient>carrot</ingredient> or two added, with half a mild <ingredient>onion,</ingredient> two or three stalks of <ingredient>celery</ingredient> and a little bag of <ingredient>sweet herbs.</ingredient> When the vegetables are very tender, press through a fine sieve and thicken very slightly as before with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter</ingredient> rubbed together.</variation></p><p><variation>Another good combination is with <ingredient>rice</ingredient> cooked very thoroughly and put through a strainer. In this case no<pb n="40" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=cclu&#38;PageNum=80"/><ingredient>flour</ingredient> is needed. Especially good with <ingredient>chicken,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>bones</ingredient> of a pair of roast <ingredient>fowls</ingredient> will make a delicious tomato soup.</variation></p><p><variation>



<purpose>WITH VARIOUS MEATS.</purpose>



--<ingredient>Tomatoes</ingredient> may be roasted, broiled, baked, fried or stewed to accompany any kind of meat, or served in an almost infinite variety of combinations. They may be fried in deep <ingredient>fat</ingredient> or saut&#233;d--why have we no good English word to express that crisp, surface frying with a little <ingredient>butter</ingredient> or <ingredient>fat</ingredient> in a very hot pan? For baking, they may be carefully skinned and baked plain, set side by side in a <implement>baking dish,</implement> and serve hot with a little <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> in the centre of each. Or the centre may be taken out carefully with a spoon, so as to leave a cup-like shell of the firm pulp, and a rich stuffing put in its place. A little <ingredient>ham</ingredient> or <ingredient>veal,</ingredient> finely minced and mixed with <ingredient>cracker</ingredient> dust, seasoned and bound together with a well-beaten <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> makes a good filling. Or the straight <ingredient>pulp</ingredient> of the <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> may be highly seasoned and mixed with grated <ingredient>onion,</ingredient> <ingredient>bread crumbs,</ingredient> <ingredient>melted butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper.</ingredient> Add a lump of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> to each on taking up.</variation></p><p><variation>



<purpose>ESCALLOPED TOMATO</purpose>



is another savory preparation which may be varied with different seasonings. Arrange in layers, alternating with the peeled and sliced <ingredient>tomato,</ingredient> <ingredient>bread crumbs</ingredient> dotted with <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and well seasoned, or a light sprinkling of <ingredient>sausage</ingredient> or very thin chips of <ingredient>bacon.</ingredient> Put a good layer of crumbs on the top and bake slowly for a full hour, then brown to a rich color.</variation></p><p><variation>



<purpose>Mushrooms and macaroni</purpose>



are two very unlike materials, either of which combines perfectly with <ingredient>tomatoes.</ingredient> <ingredient>Macaroni</ingredient> may be used for an alternate layer, as in the escallop given above. An Italian method is to first fry a little minced <ingredient>onion</ingredient> in <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and add to it a pint of tomatoes cut small, with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>black pepper,</ingredient> simmering gently until quite soft; then press through a strainer. The <ingredient>macaroni</ingredient> <pb n="41" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=cclu&#38;PageNum=81"/> is cooked in another saucepan and carefully drained, then tossed with a liberal lump of good <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> until well cooled. Stir in the <ingredient>tomato</ingredient> and serve as soon as thoroughly heated.</variation></p><p><variation>



<purpose>WITH BEANS</purpose>



.--A "left-over" of <ingredient>baked beans</ingredient> goes well combined with <ingredient>tomato.</ingredient> They may be used together, either in the form of soup or sufficiently solid for a nice hot supper or side dish. To a pint of cold baked beans add a pint of <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> and a pint of <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> cut small; also a slice or two of <ingredient>onion</ingredient> and two or three stalks of <ingredient>celery.</ingredient> Stew for twenty minutes, or longer if not in haste, and put through a strainer. Melt two tablespoonfuls of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in a saucepan and blend with two of <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> add by degrees the <ingredient>beans</ingredient> and serve very hot. Use only <ingredient>water</ingredient> enough to prevent burning, if a solid dish is wanted.</variation></p><p><variation>



<purpose>SALADS.</purpose>



-The <ingredient>tomato</ingredient> serves perfectly in a salad, either with <ingredient>lettuce</ingredient> or <ingredient>celery;</ingredient> whole, filled or sliced; with a rich <ingredient>mayonnaise,</ingredient> or with the simplest <ingredient>French dressing.</ingredient></variation></p><p><variation>With a can of <ingredient>salmon</ingredient> a very handsome and rich salad is prepared. Take out the <ingredient>salmon</ingredient> in neat, firm bits and lay them in a dish of cold spiced <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> while the <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> are prepared. Cut off the stem end and hollow out with a pointed spoon to make a neat, firm cup. Medium-sized tomatoes of even form and well ripened should be chosen. Mix a little <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>cayenne</ingredient> and <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> with or without <ingredient>oil,</ingredient> as preferred, and sprinkle the tomatoes well, then fill with the <ingredient>salmon.</ingredient> <ingredient>Cucumbers</ingredient> in paper-thin slices may be mixed with the <ingredient>fish.</ingredient> Serve on <ingredient>lettuce leaves</ingredient> with a cupful of <ingredient>mayonnaise.</ingredient></variation></p><p><variation>



<purpose>JELLIED OR FROZEN</purpose>



.--Both <ingredient>cucumbers</ingredient> and <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> are frequently served now in the form of <ingredient>jelly,</ingredient> using the <ingredient>pulp</ingredient> pressed through a <implement>steamer,</implement> with gelatine, as in other gelatine jellies. Cubes of this jelly are especially popular with chicken salad. Frozen tomato is offered in the same way with meat salads or cold luncheons. The pulp is highly <pb n="42" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=cclu&#38;PageNum=82"/> seasoned and frozen like a water ice. It is then either chilled again in small cups, to make an individual mold, or served by the spoonful upon the plates.</variation></p><p><variation>



<purpose>Tomatoes</purpose>



cannot be stewed under two to three hours to get rid of that raw, watery taste. Take five or six <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> or a can of tomatoes, throwing out the water, put in a saucepan with a small piece of <ingredient>onion,</ingredient> a bit of <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> teaspoonful of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> a pinch of <ingredient>sugar;</ingredient> let it simmer from two to three hours uncovered.

No careless hand can make a perfect salad. To be sure, Nanette, the cook, who tosses in this, adds a sprinkling of that and pours in <ingredient>oil</ingredient> and <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> with seeming abandon, sends to the table prepartions fit for the gods, But Nanette, in her line, is an artist who has acquired the simple stroke that produces the masterpiece. Occasionally there arises a genius in lay ranks who snaps her finger at experience and arrives at Nanette's degree of skill by inspiration. But geniuses are few.</p><p>In no other dish is there so wide range for individuality of treatment as in the salad. No single process in its preparation is unimportant. The meats and vegetables must not be too coarse nor too fine. In making them ready the <implement>chopping knife</implement> and <implement>meat grinder</implement> must have no part. Only the crispest, freshest vegetables should enter into its composition. Much depends upon the quality of the vinegar and oil. Sharp vinegar is to be avoided. If that on hand is too sour weaken it with a little <ingredient>water.</ingredient> A little <ingredient>lemon juice</ingredient> may be used if greater acidity is wanted. A ready supply of <ingredient>herb</ingredient> vinegars, such as <ingredient>tarragon,</ingredient> <ingredient>nasturtium,</ingredient> <ingredient>chervil,</ingredient> <ingredient>celery</ingredient> and <ingredient>mint,</ingredient> add greatly to the possibilities in flavoring. The wise salad maker has at her finger tips a knowledge of the adaptability of the different vinegars, flavors and foundation materials. The <ingredient>tarragon</ingredient> flavor, for instance, is delicious with <ingredient>meats</ingredient> and <ingredient>fish.</ingredient> The nasturtium, most persons think, lends itself best to vegetables. <ingredient>Mint vinegar</ingredient> has its votaries, but many people object to its flavor, excepting with lamb, chicken and certain green salads. <ingredient>Celery vinegar</ingredient> combines well with nearly all salads.</p><p>Chopped <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> chervil, <ingredient>sheep sorrel,</ingredient> <ingredient>nasturtiums</ingredient> <pb n="70" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=cclu&#38;PageNum=118"/> (leaves, flowers and stems), and other <ingredient>herbs</ingredient> chopped fine and sprinkled over the salad or incorporated with the dressing, ring delightful changes. At a certain farmhouse this summer tender wintergreen leaves from the woods, used moderately in various salads, puzzled the guests with their delicate fragrance.</p><p>Garlic, at which too many persons shudder, because of malodorous memories, lacks the respect in this country that its character merits. Used properly, <ingredient>garlic</ingredient> is more delicate and delicious in flavor than <ingredient>onion.</ingredient> It is the misuse of the vegetable that has gained for it its undeserved notoriety. The French know to a T its worth. A single <ingredient>clove of garlic,</ingredient> or two at the most, are enough for a large mixture. It is a good idea to rub the bowl in which the salad is dressed or the dish in which the dressing is made with a halved <ingredient>clove of garlic.</ingredient> It is still better, some think, to saturate a piece of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> with its odor and in turn to use the <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> transfixed with a fork, to wipe the dish. Another way of obtaining the flavor is to chop a <ingredient>clove or two of garlic</ingredient> to infinitesimal fineness and mix it with the other ingredients.</p><p>If <ingredient>onion</ingredient> is used, it is always preferable to employ the juice and not the pulp. By some cooks the <ingredient>onion</ingredient> is grated, but even this method leaves tangible evidence of the most odorous of vegetables to catch in the teeth and retain the flavor in the mouth. To some presons, <ingredient>onions</ingredient> are hurtful, but they are seldom injured by the juice. To obtain the juice, cut the onion in two, hold it on a fork over the mixture, and, with the back of a silver knife or spoon, press the cut side until the juice drops.</p><p>With such materials as <ingredient>lobsters,</ingredient> <ingredient>crabs,</ingredient> <ingredient>shrimps,</ingredient> Jerusalem <ingredient>artichokes,</ingredient> etc., which are liked for their individual flavors, it is a mistake to use flavored vinegars, onions or garlic. Such pungent additions are for accompaniments <pb n="71" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=cclu&#38;PageNum=119"/> of neutral hue, which need embellishment. With all salad preparations, except with the sweet kind, of course, <ingredient>capers</ingredient> and chopped <ingredient>olives</ingredient> and <ingredient>pickles</ingredient> in right proportion may always be used.</p><p>To blend the various flavors so that no one will be overshadowed by another is the acme of the salad maker's effort. Cold cooked vegetables, such as <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> <ingredient>beets,</ingredient> <ingredient>carrots,</ingredient><ingredient>string beans,</ingredient><ingredient>celery knobs,</ingredient> etc., will not absorb the dressing and its flavors. To obtain the best results most cooked vegetables should be covered with a <ingredient>French dressing</ingredient> while they are hot and should be left to cool in it. When they are cold they should be thoroughly drained. Then they may be dressed with <ingredient>mayonnaise,</ingredient> French or boiled dressing, as preferred. German cooks marinate hot <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> in this way for a cabbage salad. With the marinate may be placed an <ingredient>onion</ingredient> or two, sliced; some <ingredient>celery,</ingredient> <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient><ingredient>chervil</ingredient> or other <ingredient>herb.</ingredient> The French dressing may be made with any preferred <ingredient>vinegar.</ingredient></p><p>Utensils, ingredients and everything pertaining to the work should be chilled at the start. The <ingredient>lettuce,</ingredient> cress or other green, as well as any raw vegetable, such as <ingredient>celery</ingredient> or <ingredient>radishes,</ingredient> should stand in <ingredient>ice-water</ingredient> for an hour before they are wanted. Great care should be taken, however, when they come from the bath to dry them thoroughly. Drops of <ingredient>water</ingredient> will carry with them to the bottom of the dish an oily liquid that will detract greatly from the dainty appearance of the salad. In order to dry the vegetables drain and shake them in a <implement>colander,</implement> and then toss them about in a large, dry towel.</p><p>Stirring the ingredients together is the unpardonable sin of the art. By that means are produced the strange concoctions which are miscalled "salads." A light tossing with a fork in each hand will properly distribute the elements and seasonings and leave a light, crisp mixture.</p> <pb n="72" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=cclu&#38;PageNum=120"/><p>Salads are practically of two classes--light and heavy--the former suited to dinners, and both to luncheons and suppers. No one would think, of course, of introducing <ingredient>lobster</ingredient> or <ingredient>chicken</ingredient> salad among the courses of a heavy dinner. Such a dish is calculated to appear as the pi&#232;ce de r&#232;sistance of &#224; meal.</p><p>The appearance of the salad is not the least important factor in its preparation. Vegetables that clash in color, like <ingredient>beets,</ingredient> <ingredient>carrots</ingredient> and <ingredient>tomatoes,</ingredient> should never be mingled. The hue of the mayonnaise, or cooked dressing, may be varied by different devices. For green, <ingredient>spinach juice</ingredient> can be used, or a mixture of <ingredient>herbs,</ingredient> such as <ingredient>lettuce,</ingredient> <ingredient>cress,</ingredient> <ingredient>chives,</ingredient> <ingredient>chervil</ingredient> and <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> may be crushed together until their <ingredient>juices</ingredient> are expressed. The addition of this liquid to <ingredient>mayonnaise</ingredient> converts it into <ingredient>Ravigote sauce.</ingredient> The powdered coral of the <ingredient>lobster,</ingredient> softened with <ingredient>lemon juice,</ingredient> produces an attractive red. For other shades of red, <ingredient>tomato</ingredient> puree or <ingredient>beet juice</ingredient> may be employed. <ingredient>Yolk of egg</ingredient> will serve for yellow.</p><p>Vegetable and <ingredient>fruit cups</ingredient> afford no end of variations. <ingredient>Celery knobs</ingredient> boiled until they are tender, cut in two and scooped into cups are delicious filled with a macedoine of vegetables. A slice is usually taken from the bottom of each to enable it to stand. The vegetables are first marinated, then drained, filled into the cups and topped off with a spoonful of mayonnaise. The white cups arranged on a bed of green cress or <ingredient>lettuce</ingredient> produce a charming effect.

<recipe class1="accompaniments" ethnicgroup="creole"><p>In the summer the bowl in which 



<purpose>mayonnaise</purpose>



is made should stand in ice while the process is going on. The old time-devouring way by dropping the <ingredient>oil</ingredient> with one hand and stirring with the other has happily been obviated by various oil dropping inventions which have reduced the work to a minimum. The housekeeper is often puzzled to know what to do if the quantity of mayonnaise needed is too much for one <ingredient>raw yolk</ingredient> and not sufficient for two. By mashing a <ingredient>hard cooked yolk</ingredient> with the <ingredient>raw yolk</ingredient> the problem will be settled. The process of making is the same as if both yolks had been uncooked. They are first seasoned with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>white pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>mustard</ingredient> if it is wanted. Then the <ingredient>oil</ingredient> is dropped slowly while the beating continues rapidly.</p> <pb n="74" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=cclu&#38;PageNum=122"/><p>As the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> begin to thicken drops of <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> or <ingredient>lemon juice</ingredient> are added from time to time.</p></recipe>

After the dressing is made a layer of the salad should be removed from the plate and placed on a cold salad plate ready at hand. <ingredient>Dressing</ingredient> should be sprinkled over this and thoroughly incorporated with it.
