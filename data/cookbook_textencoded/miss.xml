If the soup is wished quite thick, add a table-spoonful of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> to that in which the vegetables were cooked, and use three table-spoonfuls of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> instead of two. Many people use <ingredient>wine</ingredient> in this soup, but it is delicious without. In case you do use wine there should not be more than four table-spoonfuls to this quantity. If you desire the soup extremely rich, use a quart of rich soup stock. The green turtles are so very large that it is only in great establishments that they are available, and for this reason a rule for preparing the live turtle is not given. Few housekeepers would ever see one. The cans contain not what is commonly called turtle soup, but the meat of the turtle, boiled, and the proper proportions of lean meat, yellow and green fat put together. They cost fifty cents each, and a single can will make soup enough for six persons.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Boiled Fish.</purpose>



A general rule for boiling <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> which will hold good for all kinds, and thus save a great deal of time and space, is this: Any fresh fish weighing between four and six pounds should be first washed in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and then put into boiling water enough to cover it, and containing one table-spoonful of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Simmer gently thirty minutes; then take up. A <implement>fish kettle</implement> is a great convenience, and it can be used also for boiling hams. When you do not have a <implement>fish kettle,</implement> keep a piece of strong white cotton cloth in which pin the fish before putting into the boiling water. This will hold it in shape. Hard boiling will break the fish, and, of course, there will be great waste, besides the dish's not looking so handsome and appetizing. There should be a gentle bubbling of the water, and nothing more, all the time the fish is in it. A fish weighing more than six pounds should cook five minutes longer for every additional <emph rend="italic">two</emph> pounds. Boiled fish can be served with a great variety of sauces. After you have learned to make them (which is a simple matter), if you cannot get a variety of fish you will not miss it particularly, the sauce and mode of serving doing much to change the whole character of the dish. Many people put a table-spoonful of <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> in the water in

which the fish is boiled. The fish flakes a little more readily for it. Small fish, like trout, require from four to eight minutes to cook. They are, however, much better baked, broiled or fried.</p>

<ingredient>Bluefish,</ingredient> <ingredient>young cod,</ingredient> <ingredient>mackerel,</ingredient> <ingredient>salmon,</ingredient> large <ingredient>trout,</ingredient> and all other fish, when they weigh between half a pound and four pounds, are nice for broiling.

The thickness of the fish will have to be the guide in broiling. A bluefish weighing four pounds will take from twenty minutes to half an hour to cook. Many cooks brown the fish handsomely over the coals and then put it into the oven to finish broiling. Where the fish is very thick, this is a good plan. If the fish is taken from the <implement>broiler</implement> to be put into the oven, it should be slipped on to a tin sheet, that it may slide easily into the platter at serving time; for nothing so mars a dish of fish as to have it come to the table broken.

<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Fried Fish.</purpose>



All small <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> like <ingredient>brook trout,</ingredient> <ingredient>smelts,</ingredient> <ingredient>perch,</ingredient> etc., are best fried. They are often called pan-fish for this reason. They should be cleaned, washed and drained, then well salted, and rolled in <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>Indian meal</ingredient> (half of each), which has been thoroughly mixed and salted. For every four pounds of fish have half a pound of <ingredient>salt pork,</ingredient> cut in thin slices, and fried a crisp brown. Take the pork from the pan and put the fish in, having only enough to cover the bottom. Fry brown on one side; turn, and fry the other side. Serve on a hot dish, with the salt pork as a garnish. Great care must be taken that the pork or fat does not burn, and yet to have it hot enough to brown quickly. Cod, haddock, cusk and halibut are all cut in handsome slices and fried in this manner; or, the slices can be well seasoned with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> dipped in beaten <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> rolled in <ingredient>bread</ingredient> or <ingredient>cracker crumbs</ingredient> and fried in boiling <ingredient>fat</ingredient> enough to cover. This method gives the handsomer dish, but the first the more savory. Where Indian meal is not liked, all flour can be used. Serve very hot. Any kind of fried fish can be served with <emph rend="italic">beurre noir,</emph> but this is particularly nice for that

and, also, the "coral," if there is any, upon a plate.

Now split the <ingredient>lobster</ingredient> through the centre and, with a fork, pick the meat from the joints. Cut the under side of the tail shell open and take out the meat without breaking. On the upper part of that end of this meat which joined the body is a small piece of flesh, which should be lifted; and a strip of meat attached to it should be turned back to the extreme end of the tail. This will uncover a little vein, running the entire length, which must be removed. Sometimes this vein is dark, and sometimes as light as the meat itself. It and the stomach are the only parts not eatable. The piece that covered the vein should be turned again into place. Hold the claws on edge on a thick board, and strike hard with a hammer until the shell cracks. Draw apart, and take out the meat. If you have the claws lying flat on the board when you strike, you not only break the shell, but mash the meat, and thus spoil a fine dish. Remember that the stomach of the lobster is found near the head, and is a small, hard sack containing poisonous matter; and that the intestinal vein is found in the tail. These should always be carefully removed. When lobster is opened in the manner explained it may be arranged handsomely on a dish, and each person can season it at the table to suit himself.</p></recipe>

After it has been cooking three hours, take the <ingredient>pork</ingredient> from the top of the fillet, spread the top thickly with butter and dredge with flour. Repeat this after thirty minutes, and then brown handsomely. Put the remainder of the butter, which should be about three table-spoonfuls, in a sauce-pan, and when hot, add two heaping table-spoonfuls of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and stir until dark brown. Add to it half a pint of <ingredient>stock</ingredient> or <ingredient>water;</ingredient> stir a minute, and set back where it will keep warm, but not cook. Now take up the fillet, and skim all the fat off of the gravy; add water enough to make half a pint of gravy, also the sauce just made. Let this boil up, and add the juice of half a lemon, and more salt and pepper, if needed. Strain, and pour around the fillet.

First singe, by holding the <ingredient>bird</ingredient> over a blazing paper. It is best to do this over the open stove, when all the particles of burnt paper will fall into the fire. Next open the vent and draw out the internal organs, if this has not been done at the butcher's. Be careful not to break the gall bladder. Wash quickly in one water. If there are large black pin-feathers, take out what you can with the point of a knife, (it is impossible to get out all). Cut the oil bag from the tail. Be sure that you have taken out every part of the wind-pipe, the lights and crop. Turn the skin back, and cut the neck quite short. Fill the crop with dressing, and put some in the body also. With a short <implement>skewer,</implement> fasten the legs together at the joint where the feet were cut off. [Be careful, in cutting off the feet of game or <ingredient>poultry,</ingredient> to cut in the joint. If you cut above, the ligaments that hold the flesh and bones together will be severed, and in cooking, the meat will shrink, leaving a bare, unsightly bone.

Place the bird on its breast, and draw the strings, with which the legs were tied, around the <implement>skewers</implement> in the wings and neck; pass them across the back three times, and tie very tightly.

<p>To clean the giblets: Cut the gall-bag from the lobe of the liver, cutting a little of the liver with it, so as not to cut into the bag. Press the heart between the finger and thumb, to extract all the blood. With a sharp knife, cut lightly around the gizzard, and draw off the outer coat, leaving the lining coat whole. If you cannot do that (and it does require practice), cut in two, and after removing the filling, take out the lining. When the poultry is to be boiled, and is stuffed, the vent must be sewed with mending cotton or soft twine.

Get a <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> that has not been frozen (freezing makes it tear easily). See that every part is whole; one with a little break in the skin will not do.

skin and fat. Begin at the neck, and run the knife between the flesh and the bones until you come to the wing. Then cut the ligaments that hold the bones together and the tendons that hold the flesh to the bones. With the thumb and fore-finger, <emph rend="italic">press</emph> the flesh from the smooth bone. When you come to the joint, carefully separate the ligaments and remove the bone. Do not try to take the bone from the next joint, as that is not in the way when carving, and it gives a more natural shape to the bird. Now begin at the wish-bone, and when that is free from the flesh, run the knife between the sides and the flesh, always using the fingers to press the meat from the smooth bones, as, for instance, the breast-bone and lower part of the sides. Work around the legs the same as you did around the wings, always using great care at the joints not to cut the skin. Drawing out the leg bones turns that part of the bird inside out. Turn the bird over, and proceed in the same manner with the other side. When all is detached, carefully draw the skin from the breast-bone; then run the knife between the fat and bone at the rump, leaving the small bone in the extreme end, as it holds the <implement>skewers.</implement> Carefully remove the flesh from the skeleton, and turn it right side out again.

Truss the same as if not boned. Take a strong piece of cotton cloth and pin the bird firmly in it, drawing very tight at the legs, as this is the broadest place, and the shape will not be good unless this precaution be taken. Steam three hours, and then place on a buttered tin sheet, which put in a <implement>baking pan.</implement> Baste well with <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Roast one hour, basting every ten minutes, and twice with stock.

it will be quite fat, and then cut in thin slices. Serve jelly with each plate.</p>



<p>Filling for a <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> weighing eight pounds: The flesh of one <ingredient>chicken</ingredient> weighing four pounds, one pound of clear <ingredient>veal,</ingredient> half a pound of clear <ingredient>salt pork,</ingredient> one small cupful of <ingredient>cracker crumbs,</ingredient> two <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> one cupful of <ingredient>broth,</ingredient> two and a half table-spoonfuls of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> half a teaspoonful of <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> one teaspoonful of <ingredient>summer savory,</ingredient> one of <ingredient>sweet majoram,</ingredient> one of <ingredient>thyme,</ingredient> half a spoonful of <ingredient>sage,</ingredient> and, if you like, one table-spoonful of <ingredient>capers,</ingredient> one quart of <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> and two table-spoonfuls of <ingredient>onion juice.</ingredient> Have the meat uncooked and free from any tough pieces. Chop <emph rend="italic">very</emph> fine. Add seasoning, crackers, etc., mix thoroughly, and use. If oysters are used, half a pound of the veal must be omitted. Where one cannot eat veal, use chicken instead. Veal is recommended for its cheapness. Why people choose boned turkey instead of a plain roast turkey or chicken, is not plain, for the flavor is not so good; but at the times and places where boned birds are used, it is a very appropriate dish. That is, at suppers, lunches and parties, where the guests are served standing, it is impracticable to provide anything that cannot be broken with a fork or spoon; therefore, the advantage of a boned turkey, chicken or bird, is apparent. One turkey weighing eight pounds before being boned, will serve thirty persons at a party, if there are, also, say oysters, rolls, coffee, ices, cake and cream. If the supper is very elaborate the turkey will answer for one of the dishes for a hundred or more persons. If nothing more were gained in the boning of a bird, the knowledge of the anatomy and the help this will give in carving, pay to bone two or three chickens. It is advisable to bone at least two fowls before trying a turkey, for if you spoil them there is nothing lost, as they make a stew or soup.</p>

The jelly can be made with the bones of the turkey and chicken, by washing them, covering with cold water and boiling down to about three pints; by then straining and setting away to cool, and in the morning skimming off all the fat and turning off the the clear stock. The bones may, instead, be used for a soup.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Roast Chicken.</purpose>



Clean the <ingredient>chicken,</ingredient> and stuff the breast and part of the body with dressing made as follows: For a pair of chickens weighing between seven and eight pounds, take one quart of <ingredient>stale bread</ingredient> (being sure not to have any hard pieces), and break up in very fine crumbs. Add a table-spoonful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> a scant teaspoonful of <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> a teaspoonful of chopped <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> half a teaspoonful of <ingredient>powdered sage,</ingredient> one of <ingredient>summer savory</ingredient> and a scant half cupful of <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Mix well together. This gives a rich dressing that will separate like rice when served. Now truss the chickens, and dredge well with salt. Take soft butter in the hand, and rub thickly over the chicken; then dredge rather thickly with <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Place on the side, on the <implement>meat rack,</implement> and put into a hot oven for a few moments, that the flour in the bottom of the pan may brown. When it is browned, put in <ingredient>water</ingredient> enough to cover the pan. Baste every fifteen minutes with the <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> in the pan, and dredge with salt, pepper and flour. When one side is browned, turn, and brown the other. The last position in which the chicken should bake is on its back, that the breast may be nicely frothed and browned. The last basting is on the breast, and should be done with soft butter, and the breast should be dredged with flour. Putting the butter on the chicken at first, and then covering with flour, makes a paste, which keeps the juices in the chicken, and also supplies a certain amount of rich basting that is absorbed into the meat. It really does not take as much butter to baste poultry or game in this manner as by the old method of putting it on with a

spoon after the bird began to cook. The water in the pan must often be renewed; and always be careful not to get in too much at a time. It will take an hour and a quarter to cook a pair of chickens, each weighing between three and a half and four pounds; anything larger, an hour and a half. A sure sign that they are done is the readiness of joints to separate from the body.

Care and practice are required for successfully making croquettes.

<p>To shape: Take about a table-spoonful of the mixture, and with both hands, shape in the form of a cylinder. Handle as gently and carefully as if a tender bird. Pressure forces the particles apart, and thus breaks the form.

Add the eggs, and beat well; then add the vinegar, and finally the milk. Place the bowl in a basin of boiling water, and stir the dressing until it thickens like soft custard. The time of cooking depends upon the thickness of the bowl. If a common white bowl is used, and it is placed in <ingredient>water</ingredient> that is boiling at the time and is kept constantly boiling, from eight to ten minutes will suffice; but if the bowl is very thick, from twelve to fifteen minutes will be needed.

<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Directions for Freezing.</purpose>



Pour the mixture that is to be frozen into the tin can, put the beater in this, and put on the cover. Place in the tub, being careful to have the point on the bottom fit into the socket in the tub. Put on the cross-piece, and turn the crank to see if everything is in the right place.</p>



<p>Next comes the packing. <ingredient>Ice</ingredient> should be broken in large pieces, and put in a canvas bag, and pounded fine with a mallet. Put a thick layer of it in the tub (about five inches deep), and then a thin layer of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Continue this until the tub is full, and pack down solid with a paddle or a common piece of wood. After turning the crank a few times add more <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and ice, and again pack down. Continue in this way until the tub is full. For a gallon can, three pints of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and perhaps ten quarts of fine ice will be required. Remember that if the freezer is packed solid at first, no more ice or <ingredient>salt</ingredient> is needed. The water must never be let off, as it is one of the strongest elements to help the freezing. If more <ingredient>salt</ingredient> than the quantity given is used, the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> will freeze sooner, but it will not be so smooth and rich as when less is used.</p>



<p>Turn the crank for twenty minutes--not fast at first, but very rapidly the last ten minutes. It will be hard to turn when the mixture is frozen. Turn back the cross-piece, wipe the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and ice from the cover, and take off the cover, not displacing the can itself. Remove the beater and scrape the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> from it. Work a large spoon up and down in the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> until it is light and the space left by taking out the beater is filled. Cover the can, cork up the hole from which the handle of the beater was taken, put on the cross piece, and set the tub in a cool place until serving time. Then dip

the can for a few seconds in <ingredient>water</ingredient> that is a trifle warm, wipe it, and turn on the dish. Rest it for a moment, and lift a little.</p>



<p>If the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is to be served from a mould, remove it when you do the beater. Fill the mould and work the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> up and down with a spoon. This will press the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> into every part, and lighten it. Cover the top of the mould with thick white paper, put on the tin cover, and bury in fresh ice and <ingredient>salt.</ingredient></p>



<p>There are a great many good freezers. The Packer is especially suited to family use. It turns so easily that any lady can make her own creams. For the first twelve minutes a child can work it. It is made of the best stock, and will last many years. The cogs on freezers should be oiled occasionally. When you have made <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> see that every part of the freezer is clean and perfectly dry before putting away.</p>

In the little town of Richmond, England, is a small pastry shop widely known for its cheese cakes. It is said that the original recipe for them was furnished by a maid of Queen Elizabeth, who had a palace at Richmond. In the neighboring city of London the cakes are in great demand, and the popular opinion there is that the only place to get them is the shop mentioned, where they are made somewhat as follows:</p>



<p>One cupful of <ingredient>sweet milk, one of sour,</ingredient> one of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> a <ingredient>lemon,</ingredient> the <ingredient>yolks of four eggs,</ingredient> a speck of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Put all the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> in the <implement>double boiler</implement> and cook until it curds; then strain.

Rub the curd through a sieve. Beat the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and <ingredient>yolks of eggs</ingredient> together, and add the <ingredient>rind and juice of the lemon</ingredient> and the curd. Line little <implement>patty pans</implement> with <ingredient>puff or chopped paste,</ingredient> rolled very thin. Put a large spoonful of the mixture in each one, and bake from fifteen to twenty minutes in a moderate oven. Do not remove from the pans until cold.

Make a <ingredient>paste</ingredient> the same as for <emph rend="italic">&#233;clairs.</emph> <ingredient>Butter</ingredient> three <implement>pie plates.</implement> Roll <ingredient>puff or chopped paste</ingredient> very thin, and cover the plates with it. Cut off the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> about an inch from the edge all round the plates. Spread a thin layer of the cooked <ingredient>paste</ingredient> over the <ingredient>puff paste.</ingredient> Put a tube, measuring about half an inch in diameter, in a pastry bag. Turn the remainder of the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> into the bag and press it through the tube on to the edges of the plates, where the <ingredient>puff paste</ingredient> has been cut off. Care must be taken to have the border of equal thickness all round the plates. With a fork, prick holes in the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> in the centre of the plate. Bake half an hour in a moderate oven. When the plates have been put in the oven, make what <ingredient>paste</ingredient> is left in the bag into balls about half the size of an American walnut. There will be enough for three dozen. Drop them into a pan that has been buttered lightly, and bake fifteen or twenty minutes. While they are baking, put half a cupful of <ingredient>water</ingredient> and half a cupful of <ingredient>granulated sugar</ingredient> in a small sauce-pan, and boil twenty-five minutes.</p>



<p>When the little balls and the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> in the plate is done, take the balls on the point of a <implement>skewer</implement> or large needle, dip them in the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> and place them on the border of <ingredient>paste</ingredient> (the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> will hold them), about two inches apart. A word of caution just here: Do not stir the <ingredient>syrup,</ingredient> as that will make it grain, and, of course, spoil it. A good plan is to pour part of the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> into a small cup, which place in hot <ingredient>water.</ingredient> That remaining in the sauce-pan should be kept hot, but it

should not boil, until needed. When all the balls have been used, dip four dozen <ingredient>French candied cherries</ingredient> in the <ingredient>syrup,</ingredient> and stick them between the balls. Reserve about fifteen <ingredient>cherries,</ingredient> with which to garnish the centre of the cake.</p>



<p>Whip one pint and a half of <ingredient>cream</ingredient> to a froth. Soak half a package of <ingredient>gelatine</ingredient> in half a cupful of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> for two hours. Pour on this half a cupful of boiling <ingredient>milk.</ingredient> Place the pan of <ingredient>whipped cream</ingredient> in another of <ingredient>ice water,</ingredient> and sprinkle over it two-thirds of a cupful of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and nearly a teaspoonful of <ingredient>vanilla flavor.</ingredient> Strain the gelatine on this, and stir gently from the bottom until it begins to thicken. When it will just pour, fill the three plates with it, and set them in the <implement>ice chest</implement> for half an hour.

If the rusks are wanted warm for tea, the sponge must, of course, be set early in the morning.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Boiled Coffee.</purpose>



The old method of boiling <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is still practised by at least one-half the housekeepers in this country. The <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is sometimes boiled with an <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> which makes it perfectly clear, and also enriches it. When an <ingredient>egg</ingredient> is not used a small piece of <ingredient>salt fish skin</ingredient> is boiled with the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> to clear it.</p>

As soon as it has boiled enough, pour in a cupful of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and turn a little of the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> into a cup, to see that the nozzle of the pot is not filled with grounds. Turn this back, and let the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> stand a few moments to settle, taking care that it does not boil again. The advantages of boiled <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> are that when the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> is used the <ingredient>yolk</ingredient> gives a very rich flavor, and when the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is added the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> has a rich, yellow look, which is pleasing. It has also a peculiar flavor, which many people prefer to the flavor gained by any other process. The disadvantages are that the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> coats the dry <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> and when the hot <ingredient>water</ingredient> is added the coating becomes hard, and a great deal of the best of the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> remains in the grounds after boiling.

<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Filtered Coffee.</purpose>



Another--and really the most economical and the easiest--way of making <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is by filtering. The <implement>French coffee biggin</implement> is valuable for this. It consists of two cylindrical tin vessels, one fitting into another, and the bottom of the upper being a fine strainer. Another coarser strainer, with a rod running from the centre, is placed upoon this. Then the <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> which must be finely-ground, is put in, and another strainer is placed at the top of the rod. The <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> is poured on, and the pot set where it will keep hot, but not boil, until the <ingredient>water</ingredient> has gone through. This will make a clear, strong <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> with a rich, smooth flavor. The advantage of the two extra strainers is that the one coming next to the fine strainer prevents the grounds from filling up the fine holes, and so the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is clear, and made more easily. The



 



<pb n="390" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=394"/>

Cut thin, even slices parallel with the rind, and cut these in long, narrow strips that will fit into the needle. For <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> <ingredient>veal,</ingredient> <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> or <ingredient>chicken</ingredient> the strips should be about as large round as a lead pencil, and about three and a half inches long; and for <ingredient>birds,</ingredient> <ingredient>chops,</ingredient> and <ingredient>sweetbreads</ingredient> they should be about as large round as a match. Three slices are all that can be cut from one piece of <ingredient>pork,</ingredient> because when you get more than an inch away from the rind, the <ingredient>pork</ingredient> is so tender that it will break when in the needle.</p>



<p>Put the strips in a bowl of broken <ingredient>ice,</ingredient> to harden. Have the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> if <ingredient>beef</ingredient> or <ingredient>veal,</ingredient> free of skin and gristle. Put a strip (also called a lardoon) into the needle as far as it will go. With a <implement>skewer</implement> or knife draw a line on both sides of the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and along the upper part. Thrust the needle into the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> at one of the side lines; and when it is about half way through to the top of the piece, press the steel slightly with the thumb and fore-finger, to hold the lardoon in place until it has entered the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> Now push the needle through to the top, and gently draw it out, leaving about three-quarters of an inch of the strip exposed at both the side and upper part of the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> That part of the <ingredient>pork</ingredient> which is hidden should be half an inch under the surface. The needle's course is as if it started under the eaves of a gable roof and came out at the ridge-pole. Continue until all the rows are filled with lardoons. Two rows are enough for a <ingredient>fillet of beef.</ingredient> If the

strips are too large for the needle they will be pressed out as soon as the lower part of the needle enters the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient></p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">To Stew.</purpose>



The <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and vegetables for stews should, when it is possible, be browned in a little <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> and hot <ingredient>water</ingredient> should then be added. As soon as the stew comes to the boiling point, skim it, and set back where it will just simmer, not boil, the given time. The pieces of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> in a stew should come to the table whole and tender and juicy, and they will be in this condition only with <emph rend="italic">slow</emph> cooking.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">To Braise.</purpose>



Braising is one of the best modes of preparing <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> There are pans expressly for braising; but any deep tin, sheet iron, or <implement>granite-ware</implement> pan, with a cover, will answer quite well. The <ingredient>meat</ingredient> to be cooked must always be browned in some kind of <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> the vegetables fried in the same <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> and enough <ingredient>stock</ingredient> (if possible) or <ingredient>water</ingredient> be added to half cover the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> The pan should then be covered and placed in the oven. The <ingredient>meat</ingredient> must cook <emph rend="italic">slowly</emph> and thoroughly, and be basted frequently. No matter how tough, if properly braised it will become tender and juicy. If, however, the cooking is hurried the dish will be spoiled.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">To Fry.</purpose>



There are two modes of frying. One is to have just enough <ingredient>fat</ingredient> to prevent the article from burning or sticking; and the other is to have enough not only to cover the food, but to float it. The latter is by far the better way, as all the surface of the article is instantly hardened, and, therefore, will not absorb <ingredient>fat.</ingredient> It is also the cheaper way, because the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> can be used so many times. If the <ingredient>drippings saved from meats, soups and gravies</ingredient> should not be enough for frying purposes, buy pure <ingredient>lard</ingredient> to use with it. Many recommend buying <ingredient>beef suet</ingredient> for this same purpose; but food fried in <ingredient>suet</ingredient> is more liable to absorb <ingredient>fat</ingredient> than that fried in <ingredient>lard.</ingredient> The



 



<pb n="399" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=403"/>



reason of this is that <ingredient>lard</ingredient> can be heated to a higher temperature without burning than can <ingredient>beef</ingredient> or any of the other fats. <ingredient>Butter</ingredient> is also often recommended for frying. If used, it should be free of salt. But aside from being so expensive, it is not so nice for frying purposes as fats, for it burns at a much lower temperature than either <ingredient>beef fat</ingredient> or <ingredient>lard.</ingredient> The <implement>Scotch kettle</implement> is the <emph rend="italic">best</emph> utensil for frying. It rests on a rim, which lifts the bottom from the stove, and the inside surface is polished very smooth; therefore, the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is less liable to burn than if the surface were rough and the bottom rested on the hot stove. The <ingredient>fat</ingredient> should heat gradually; and when the food is plunged into it a slight smoke should rise from the <emph rend="italic">centre.</emph> It will smoke at the sides some time before it has become hot enough for frying. After the food has been put in, let the kettle stand on the hottest part of the stove until it regains its former temperature, and then set it back where it is not quite so hot. In frying <ingredient>fish-balls,</ingredient> <ingredient>doughnuts,</ingredient> etc., put only a few at a time in the boiling <ingredient>fat;</ingredient> then wait a few moments for the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> to regain its former temperature, and put in a few more. <ingredient>Fish-balls</ingredient> are often spoiled by the putting of a great many in the kettle at once. The temperature of the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is instantly reduced, and the balls absorb the <ingredient>fat.</ingredient> When an article of food is fried, drain the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> from it, and lay it on a sheet of brown paper in a warm pan. The paper will absorb any <ingredient>fat</ingredient> that may remain on the food. As soon as you are through frying, take the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> from the fire, and when cooled a little, strain it. (See the chapter on the Care of Food.) If the directions given are followed, there will be no difficulty in having food fried without its being saturated with grease.</p>
