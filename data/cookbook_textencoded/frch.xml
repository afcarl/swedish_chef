<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose placement="heading" align="center">APPLE PIE.</purpose>



When you make apple pies, stew your <ingredient>apples</ingredient> very little indeed; just strike them through, to make them tender. Some people do not stew them at all; but cut them up in very thin slices, and lay them in the crust. Pies made in this way may retain more of the spirit of the <ingredient>apple;</ingredient> but I do not think the seasoning mixes in as well. Put in <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> to your taste; it is impossible to make a precise rule; because <ingredient>apples</ingredient> vary so much in acidity.

<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose placement="heading" align="center">PANCAKES.</purpose>



Pancakes should be made of half a pint of <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> three great spoonfuls of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> two or three <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> a tea-spoonful of dissolved <ingredient>pearlash,</ingredient> spiced with <ingredient>cinnamon,</ingredient> or <ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> a little <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>rose-water,</ingredient> or <ingredient>lemon-brandy,</ingredient> just as you happen to have it. <ingredient>Flour</ingredient> should be stirred in, till the spoon moves round with difficulty. If they are thin, they are apt to soak fat. Have the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> in your skillet boiling hot, and drop them in with a spoon. Let them cook till thoroughly brown. The <ingredient>fat</ingredient> which is left is good to shorten other cakes. The more <ingredient>fat</ingredient> they are cooked in, the less they soak.</p><p><variation>If you have no eggs, or wish to save them, use the above ingredients, and supply the place of eggs by two or three spoonfuls of <ingredient>lively emptings;</ingredient> but in this case they must be made five or six hours before they are cooked,--and in winter they should stand all night.</variation> A spoonful or more of <ingredient>N.

<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose placement="heading" align="center">FRITTERS.</purpose>



Flat-jack, or fritters, do not differ from pancakes, only in being mixed softer. The same ingredients are used in about the same quantities, only most people prefer to have no sweetening put in them, because they generally have <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and <ingredient>nutmeg</ingredient> put on them, after they are done. Excepting for company, the <ingredient>nutmeg</ingredient> can be well dispensed with. They are not to be boiled in fat, like pancakes; the <implement>spider,</implement> or griddle, should be well greased, and the cakes poured on as large as you want them, when it is quite hot; when it gets brown on one side to be turned over upon the other. Fritters are better to be baked quite thin. Either <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> <ingredient>Indian,</ingredient> or <ingredient>rye,</ingredient> is good.</p><p><ingredient>Sour beer,</ingredient> with a spoonful of <ingredient>pearlash,</ingredient> is good both for pancakes and fritters.</p><p><variation>If you have any cold <ingredient>rice</ingredient> left, it is nice to break it up fine in <ingredient>warm milk,</ingredient> put in a little <ingredient>salt;</ingredient> after you have put <ingredient>milk</ingredient> enough for the cakes you wish to make, (a half pint, or more,) stir in <ingredient>flour</ingredient> till it is thick enough to pour for fritters. It does very well without an <ingredient>egg;</ingredient> but better with one.

If you have <ingredient>sour milk,</ingredient> or <ingredient>butter-milk,</ingredient> it is well to make it into short cakes, for tea.

should have a <ingredient>sponge</ingredient> set the night before. The <ingredient>sponge</ingredient> should be soft enough to pour; mixed with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> warm or cold, according to the temperature of the weather. One gill of <ingredient>lively yeast</ingredient> is enough to put into <ingredient>sponge</ingredient> for two loaves. I should judge about three pints of <ingredient>sponge</ingredient> would be right for two loaves. The warmth of the place in which the <ingredient>sponge</ingredient> is set, should be determined by the coldness of the weather. If your <ingredient>sponge</ingredient> looks frothy in the morning, it is a sign your bread will be good; if it does not rise, stir in a little more <ingredient>emptings;</ingredient> if it rises too much, taste of it, to see if it has any acid taste; if so, put in a tea spoonful of <ingredient>pearlash,</ingredient> when you mould in your <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> be sure the <ingredient>pearlash</ingredient> is well dissolved in <ingredient>water;</ingredient> if there are little lumps, your bread will be full of bitter spots. About an hour before your oven is ready, stir in <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into your <ingredient>sponge</ingredient> till it is stiff enough to lay on a well floured board, or table. Knead it up pretty stiff and put it into well greased pans, and let it stand in a cool, or warm place, according to the weather. If the oven is ready, put them in fifteen or twenty minutes after the dough begins to rise up and crack; if the oven is not ready, move the pans to a cooler spot, to prevent the dough from becoming sour by too much rising. Common sized loaves will bake in three quarters of an hour. If they slip easily in the pans, it is a sign they are done. Some people do not set a soft sponge for flour bread; they knead it up all ready to put in the pans the night before, and leave it to rise. White bread and pies should not be set in the oven until the brown bread and beans have been in half an hour. If the oven be too hot, it will bind the crust so suddenly that the bread cannot rise; if it be too cold, the bread will fall. Flour bread should not be too stiff.</p><p><variation>Some people like one third of <ingredient>Indian</ingredient> in their flour.<pb n="83" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=frch&#38;PageNum=91"/> Others like one third <ingredient>rye;</ingredient> and some think the nicest of all bread is one third <ingredient>Indian,</ingredient> one third <ingredient>rye,</ingredient> and one third <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> made according to the directions for flour bread.

Leave the bung loose till the beer is done working; you can ascertain this by observing when the froth subsides. If your family be large, and the beer will be drank rapidly, it may as well remain in the barrel; but if your family be small, fill what bottles you have with it; it keeps better bottled. A <ingredient>raw potato</ingredient> or two, cut up and thrown in, while the ingredients are boiling, is said to make beer spirited.</p><p><variation><purpose>Ginger beer</purpose>
