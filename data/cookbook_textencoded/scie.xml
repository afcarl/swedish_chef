<p><purpose rend="bold" placement="inline">Popped Corn.</purpose>



--The small, translucent varieties of maize known as <ingredient>"pop corn,</ingredient>" possess the property, when gently roasted, of bursting open, or turning inside out, a process which is owing to the following facts: <ingredient>Corn</ingredient> contains an excess of fatty matter. By proper means this <ingredient>fat</ingredient> can be separated from the grain, and it is then a thick, pale <ingredient>oil.</ingredient> When oils are heated sufficiently in a vessel closed from the air, they are turned into gas, which occupies many times the bulk of the <ingredient>oil.</ingredient> When pop corn is gradually heated, and made so hot that the <ingredient>oil</ingredient> inside of the kernel turns to gas, being unable to escape through the hull of the kernel, the pressure finally becomes strong enough to burst the grain, and the explosion is so violent as to shatter it in a most curious manner.</p>



<p>Popped corn forms an excellent food, the starch of the grain being well cooked. It should, however, be eaten in connection with other food at mealtime, and not as a delicacy between meals. Ground pop corn is considered a delectable dish eaten with <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>cream;</ingredient> it also forms the base of several excellent puddings.</p>



<p>To pop the <ingredient>corn,</ingredient> shell and place in a wire "popper" over a bed of bright <ingredient>coals,</ingredient> or on the top of a hot stove; stir or shake continuously, so that each kernel may be subjected to the same degree of heat on all sides, until it begins to burst open. If a popper is not attainable, a common iron skillet covered tightly, and very lightly oiled on the bottom, may be used for the purpose. The <ingredient>corn</ingredient> must be very dry to begin with, and if good, nearly every kernel will pop open nicely. It should be used within twenty-four hours after popping.</p>

<p><emph rend="italic">French Rolls</emph> may be made by shaping each portion of dough into small oval rolls quite tapering at each end, allowing them to become light, and baking far enough apart so that one will not touch another.</p>



<p>If, when the dough is light and ready to shape, it be rolled on the board until about one eighth of an inch in thickness, and cut into five-inch squares, then divided through the center into triangles, rolled up, beginning with the wide side, and placed in the pan to rise in semicircular shape, the rolls are called <emph rend="italic">Crescents.</emph></p>



<p>What are termed <emph rend="italic">Parker House Rolls</emph> may be made from well-risen dough prepared with <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> rolled upon the board to a uniform thickness of

about one-fourth inch; cut into round or oval shapes with a cutter; folded, one third over the other two thirds; allowed to rise until very light, and baked.</p>



<p>The light, rolled dough may be formed into a <emph rend="italic">Braid</emph> by cutting into strips six inches in length and one in width, joining the ends of each three, and braiding.</p>



<p>The heat of the oven should be somewhat greater for rolls and biscuit than for bread.> The time required will depend upon the heat and the size of the roll, but it will seldom exceed one half hour. Neither rolls nor <ingredient>biscuit</ingredient> should be eaten hot, as they are then open to the same objections as other new yeast bread.</p>

<p><purpose rend="bold" placement="inline">Hot Milk.</purpose>



--<ingredient>Milk</ingredient> is more easily digested when used hot. This is not due to any marked chemical change in the <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> but to the stimulating effect of heat upon the palate and stomach.</p>



<p>To prepare hot <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> heat it in a <implement>double boiler</implement> until a wrinkled skin appears upon the surface. In the <implement>double boiler</implement> it may be kept at the proper temperature for a long time without difficulty, and thus prepared, it forms one of the most healthful of foods.</p>



<p><ingredient>Milk,</ingredient> either cold or hot, should be taken a few sips only at a time, and not be drank in copious draughts when used in connection with other foods at mealtime. It will then coagulate in the stomach in small flakes much more easily digested than the large mass resulting when a large quantity is swallowed at a time.</p>

<p><purpose rend="bold" placement="inline"> <alt synonym1="Eggs cooked with shells"></alt>Eggs in Shell.</purpose>



--The usual method of preparing <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> for serving in this way is to put them into <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> and boil or simmer until they are considered sufficiently cooked. Albumen, of which the <ingredient>white of the egg</ingredient> is composed, is easiest digested when simply coagulated. The <ingredient>yolk,</ingredient> if cooked at all, is easiest digested when dry and mealy. Albumen coagulates at 160&#176;, and when the boiling point is reached, it becomes hardened, tough, and leathery, and very difficult of digestion. If the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> were all albumen, it might be easily and properly cooked by dropping into <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> allowing it to remain for a few seconds, and removing it, since the shell of the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> would prevent its becoming sufficiently heated



 



<pb n="385" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=scie&#38;PageNum=409"/>



in so short a time as to become hardened; but the time necessary to cook properly the <ingredient>white of the egg</ingredient> would be insufficient for the heat to penetrate to and cook the <ingredient>yolk;</ingredient> and if it is desirable to cook the <ingredient>yolk </ingredient> hard, the cooking process should be carried on at a temperature below the boiling point, subjecting the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> to a less degree of heat, but for a longer time. The most accurate method is to put the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> into <ingredient>water</ingredient> of a temperature of 160&#176;, allowing them to remain for twenty minutes and not permitting the temperature of the <ingredient>water</ingredient> to go above 165&#176;. Cooked in this way, the <ingredient>white</ingredient> will be of a soft, jelly-like consistency throughout, while the <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> will be <ingredient>hard.</ingredient> If it is desired to have the <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> dry and mealy, the temperature of the <ingredient>water</ingredient> must be less, and the time of cooking lengthened. We have secured the most perfect results with <ingredient>water</ingredient> at a temperature of 150&#176;, and seven hours' cooking. The temperature of the <ingredient>water</ingredient> can be easily tested by keeping in it an ordinary thermometer, and if one possesses a kerosene or gas stove, the heat can be easily regulated to maintain the required temperature.</p>



<p>Another method, although less sure, is to pour <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> into a saucepan, draw it to one side of the range where it will keep hot, but not boil, put in the <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> cover, and let stand for twenty minutes. If by either method it is desired to have the <ingredient>yolk</ingredient> soft-cooked, lessen the time to ten minutes or so, according to the hardness desired. <ingredient>Eggs</ingredient> are best served as soon as done, as the <ingredient>white</ingredient> becomes more solid by being kept in a hot shell.</p>



<p>It should be remarked that the time necessary to cook <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> in the shell will vary somewhat with the firmness of the shell, the size of the <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> and the number cooked together.</p>

--The aitch-bone and pieces from the shin, the upper part of the <ingredient>chuck-rib</ingredient> and <ingredient>neck of beef,</ingredient> are the parts most commonly used for stewing.

The <ingredient>bones,</ingredient> however, should not be crushed or splintered, but carefully sawed or broken, and any small pieces removed before cooking. It is generally considered that <ingredient>beef</ingredient> which has been previously browned makes a much more savory stew, and it is quite customary first to brown the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> by frying in hot <ingredient>fat.</ingredient> A much more wholesome method, and one which will have the same effect as to flavor, is to add to the stew the remnants of roasts or <ingredient>steak.</ingredient> It is well when selecting <ingredient>meat</ingredient> for a stew to procure a portion, which, like the aitch-<ingredient>bone,</ingredient> has enough juicy <ingredient>meat</ingredient> upon it to serve the first day as a roast for a small family.
