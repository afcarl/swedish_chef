<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading"><ingredient>BREAD</ingredient> AND ROLLS</purpose> <ingredient>Bread,</ingredient> called the "Staff of Life," on account of its nutritive value, should <ingredient>head</ingredient> the list of foods for human consumption. <ingredient>Bread</ingredient> making should stand first in the "Science of Cooking," as there is no one food upon which the comfort, health and well-being of the average family so largely depends as upon good <ingredient>bread.</ingredient> There is absolutely no reason why the housewife of the present day should not have good, sweet, wholesome, home-made <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> if good <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> good <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and common-sense are used. The <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or wafer used to mix with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> for making <ingredient>bread</ingredient> sponge should be lukewarm. If too hot, the loaves will be full of holes and coarse grained. If too cold the <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> chilled, will not rise as it should have done had the liquid used been the right temperature. Good <ingredient>bread</ingredient> may be made by using <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> <ingredient>potato water</ingredient> or <ingredient>whey</ingredient> (drained from <ingredient>thick sour milk</ingredient>), and good <ingredient>bread</ingredient> may be made by simply using <ingredient>lukewarm water.</ingredient> I prefer a mixture of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and <ingredient>water</ingredient> to set sponge. <ingredient>Milk</ingredient> makes a finegrained, <ingredient>white bread,</ingredient> but it soon dries out and becomes stale. <ingredient>Bread</ingredient> rises more slowly when <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is used. When<pb n="168" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=212"/> mashed <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> are used, the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> keeps moist a longer time. Should you wish extra fine, <ingredient>white,</ingredient> delicate <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> add one cup of sweet <ingredient>cream</ingredient> to the liquid when setting sponge. When <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is used the dough is slower in rising, but makes a creamy-looking and fine-flavored <ingredient>bread.</ingredient> When one Fleischman <ingredient>yeast cake</ingredient> is used in any recipe the ordinary half-ounce cake of compressed <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> is intended, twenty-eight cakes in a pound. These are usually kept in a large refrigerator in a temperature of 44 degrees and should not be kept longer in the home than three days in Summer or six days in Winter, and should always be kept in a cool place until used, if the cook would have success when using.</p><p>Use the best <ingredient>hard,</ingredient> Spring <ingredient>wheat flour</ingredient> obtainable for baking <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> or any sponge raised with <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> as this <ingredient>flour</ingredient> contains a greater quantity of gluten and makes <ingredient>bread</ingredient> of high nutritive value.</p><p><ingredient>Winter wheat</ingredient> maybe used for cake-making and for baking pastry with excellent results, although costing less than Spring <ingredient>wheat.</ingredient></p><p>Always sift <ingredient>flour</ingredient> before using, when setting sponge for <ingredient>bread.</ingredient> <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> "Aunt Sarah" always cut several gashes with a sharp knife on top of loaves when ready to be placed in oven. She also made several cuts across the top of loaves with a hot knife when set to rise to allow gas to escape. If an impression made on a loaf of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> with the finger remains, the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is light. If the dent disappears, then the loaf is not light enough to be placed in the oven; give it more time to rise. An experienced cook, noted for the excellence and size of her loaves of <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> said she always inverted a pan over the pan containing loaves of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> when set to rise, and allowed the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> to remain covered after being placed in the oven. Loaves will rise to a greater height if this is done. Remove the covering to allow loaves to brown a short time before taking them from the oven. "Aunt Sarah" frequently placed four loaves in her large roasting pan, covered the pan, when set to rise, and allowed the cover to remain until loaves Were nearly baked. She brushed the top and sides of loaves with melted <ingredient>butter</ingredient> When set to rise to allow of their being broken apart easily. A more crusty loaf is secured by placing each loaf singly in medium-sized <ingredient>bread</ingredient> tins.</p><p>Aunt Sarah considered Fleischrnan's compressed <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> the best commercial <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> in use, both quick and reliable, but thought better <ingredient>bread</ingredient> was never made than that made by her mother, as<pb n="169" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=213"/> she had been taught to make it in years past, by the old-fashioned and slower "sponge method." She was invariably successful in making sweet, wholesome <ingredient>bread</ingredient> in that manner. She used homemade <ingredient>potato yeast</ingredient> or "<ingredient>cornmeal yeast cakes,</ingredient>" under different names, always with good results.</p><p>Good <ingredient>bread</ingredient> may be made either by the old-fashioned "sponge" method or "straight." Sponge method consists of a batter mixed from liquid <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> (usually home-made <ingredient>potato yeast</ingredient> is used) and a small part of the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> required for making the <ingredient>bread.</ingredient> This batter was usually set to rise at night and mixed up in the centre of a quantity of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> in an old-fashioned wooden dough tray. The following morning enough <ingredient>flour</ingredient> was kneaded in to form a dough, and when well-raised and light, this dough was formed into loaves and placed in pans for the final rising. The more easily and more quickly made "straight" dough, when using Fleischman's compressed <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> is mixed in the morning and all the ingredients necessary are added at one time. It is then set to rise and, when the dough has doubled in bulk, it is kneaded down and when risen to once and half its size, shaped into loaves, placed in pans to rise and, when risen to top of pans, bake.</p><p>Better <ingredient>bread</ingredient> may be made from <ingredient>flour</ingredient> not freshly milled. <ingredient>Flour</ingredient> should be kept in a dry place; it improves with moderate age. Stand <ingredient>flour</ingredient> in a warm place to dry out several hours before , using if you would have good <ingredient>bread.</ingredient></p><p>When baking <ingredient>bread</ingredient> the heat of the oven should not he too great at 



<emph rend="italic">first</emph>, or the outside of the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> will harden too quickly and inside the loaves will not be thoroughly baked before the crust is thick and dark. The temperature of the oven and time required for baking depend upon the size of the loaves, yet the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> should be placed in rather a quick oven, one in which the loaves should brown in about fifteen minutes, when the heat may be reduced, finishing the baking more slowly.</p><p>Small <ingredient>biscuits</ingredient> and rolls can stand a much hotter oven and quicker baking than large loaves, which must be heated slowly, and baked a longer time. A one-pound loaf should bake about one hour. On being taken from the oven, <ingredient>bread</ingredient> should be placed on a sieve so that the air can circulate about it until it is thoroughly cooled. In the 



<emph rend="italic">Farmers' Bulletin</emph> we read: "The lightness and sweetness depend as much on the way <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is made as on the materials used." The greatest care should be used in preparing<pb n="170" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=214"/> and baking the dough and in cooking and keeping the finished <ingredient>bread.</ingredient> Though good housekeepers agree that light, well-raised <ingredient>bread</ingredient> can readily be made, with reasonable care and attention, heavy, badly-rasied <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is unfortunately every common. Such <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is not palatable and is generally considered to be unwholesome, and probably more indigestion has been caused by it than by any other badly-cooked food. As compared with most <ingredient>meats</ingredient> and vegetables, <ingredient>bread</ingredient> has practically no waste and is very completely digested, but it is usually too poor in proteins to be fittingly used as the <ingredient>sole</ingredient> article of diet, but when eaten with due quantities of other food, it is invaluable and well deserves its title of "Staff of Life."</p><p>When the housewife "sets" <ingredient>bread</ingredient> sponge to rise over night, she should mix the sponge or dough quite late, and early in the morning mold it at once into shapely-looking loaves (should the sponge have had the necessary amount of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> added the night before for making a stiff dough).</p><p>Being aware of the great nutritive value of <ingredient>raisins</ingredient> and <ingredient>dried currants.</ingredient> Aunt Sarah frequently added a cup of either one or the other, well-<ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed, to the dough when shaping into loaves for the final rising.</p><p>Aunt Sarah frequently used a mixture of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>lard</ingredient> when baking on account of its being more economical, and for the reason that a lesser quantity of <ingredient>lard</ingredient> may be used; the <ingredient>shortening</ingredient> qualities being greater than that of <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> The taste of <ingredient>lard</ingredient> was never detected in her <ingredient>bread</ingredient> or cakes, they being noted for their excellence, as the <ingredient>lard</ingredient> she used was home-rendered, almost as sweet as dairy <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> free from taste or odor of <ingredient>pork.</ingredient> She always beat <ingredient>lard</ingredient> to a <ingredient>cream</ingredient> when using it for baking cakes, and salted it well before using, and I do not think the small quantity used could be objected to on hygienic priciples.</p><p>I have read "<ingredient>bread</ingredient> baking" is done once every three or four weeks, no oftener, in some of the farm houses of Central Europe, and yet <ingredient>stale bread</ingredient> is there unknown. Their method of keeping <ingredient>bread</ingredient> fresh is to sprinkle <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into a large sack and into this pack the loaves, taking care to have the top crusts of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> touch each other. If they have to lie bottom to bottom, sprinkle <ingredient>flour</ingredient> between them. Swing the sack in a dry place. It must swing and there must be plenty of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> between the loaves. It sounds more odd than reasonable, I confess.</p>

Turn the bowl containing the loaf carefully upside down on the centre of a hot sheet iron taken from the hot oven and placed on top of range.

Remove cloth from dough carefully after it has been turned from bowl and place the sheet iron containing loaf 



<emph rend="italic">immediately in the hot oven</emph>, as it will then rise at once and not spread. Bake at least sixty minutes. <ingredient>Bread</ingredient> is seldom baked long enough to be wholesome, especially <ingredient>graham</ingredient> and <ingredient>rye bread.</ingredient> When baked and still hot, brush the top of loaf with <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and wash the bottom of loaf well with a cloth wrung out of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> to soften the lower, <ingredient>hard</ingredient>-baked crust.

The <ingredient>bread</ingredient> baked from this recipe has the taste of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> which, in olden times, was baked in the brick ovens of our grandmother's day, and that <ingredient>bread</ingredient> was unexcelled.

The three edges of the sheet iron turned down all around to a depth of half an inch, the two opposite corners being cut off about a half inch, to allow of its being turned down. It is a great convenience for young housewives to possess two of these sheet-iron tins, or "baking sheets," when baking small cakes or cookies, as being raised slightly from the bottom of the oven, cakes are less liable to scorch and bake more evenly. One sheet may be filled while baking another sheetful of cakes. In this manner a large number of cakes may be baked in a short time. This baking sheet was turned the opposite way, upside down, when baking a loaf of<pb n="173" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=217"/> <ingredient>rye bread</ingredient> on it, and when the loaf of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> was partly baked the extra baking sheet was slipped under the bottom of the one containing: the loaf, in case the oven was quite hot, to prevent the bottom of the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> scorching. <ingredient>Wheat bread</ingredient> may be baked in the same manner as <ingredient>rye bread,</ingredient> substituting <ingredient>wheat flour</ingredient> for <ingredient>rye.</ingredient> These baking sheets may be made by any tinsmith, and young housewives, I know, would not part with them, once they realize how invaluable they are for baking small cakes on them easily and quickly.</p>

<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">BUCKS COUNTY <ingredient>CINNAMON</ingredient> "KUCHEN"</purpose> Explicit directions for the making of these excellent raised cakes was given Mary by an old, experienced Pennsylvania German cook. They were prepared from the following recipe: Early in the morning 1 pint of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> was scalded. When lukewarm, add 3 1/2 cups of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and 1 cake of Fleischman's compressed <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> (which had been dissolved in 1 tablespoonful of <ingredient>lukewarm water</ingredient>). Beat the mixture well. Cover and stand in a warm place to rise. When well risen, which should be in about 2 hours, add the following mixture, composed of 3/4 cup of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and 1/2 cup of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> creamed together; 1/2 teaspoonful of <ingredient>salt;</ingredient> 1 <ingredient>egg</ingredient> was beaten into the mixture, and about 2 cups of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> were added, enough to make a dough as stiff as can be stirred with a spoon. Dough should not be as stiff as for <ingredient>bread.</ingredient> Let stand about 1 hour. When well risen and light, divide into four portions. Roll out each piece of dough to thickness of one inch. Place cakes in medium-sized pie tins and allow them to stand about one hour. When well risen, doubled in bulk, make half dozen deep impressions on top of each cake with the forefinger. Brush top of each cake with 1/2 tablespoonful of melted <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Sprinkle over 2 tablespoonfuls of soft A <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and sift over a little<pb n="200" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=244"/> <ingredient>pulverized cinnamon,</ingredient> if liked, just before placing cakes in oven. Bake cakes from 20 to 25 minutes in a moderately hot oven. From this dough may be made four cakes.</p><p>Excellent <ingredient>biscuits</ingredient> may also be made from this same dough, by simply moulding it into small <ingredient>biscuits</ingredient> and place in a pan some distance apart. Let rise and brush tops of <ingredient>biscuits</ingredient> with a mixture composed of a part of an <ingredient>egg yolk,</ingredient> a tablespoonful of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and 1/2 teaspoonful <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient> This causes the <ingredient>biscuits</ingredient> to have a rich, brown color when baked.</p><p>The sponge from which these cakes or <ingredient>biscuits</ingredient> were made was mixed and set to rise at 6 o'clock in the morning, and the baking was finished at 11 o'clock. Sponge should be set to rise in a warm room. If these directions are carefully followed the housewife will invariably have good results. Always use <ingredient>hard</ingredient> Spring <ingredient>wheat</ingredient> for <ingredient>bread</ingredient> or <ingredient>biscuits,</ingredient> raised with <ingredient>yeast;</ingredient> and <ingredient>Winter wheat,</ingredient> which costs less, will answer for making cake and pastry.

<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">FRITTERS, CROQUETTES, DUMPLINGS AND CRULLERS</purpose> When cooking any article to be immersed in <ingredient>fat</ingredient> use about this proportion: 2 pounds of <ingredient>sweet lard</ingredient> to 1 of <ingredient>suet,</ingredient> which had been previously tried out. It is cheaper, also more wholesome, to use part <ingredient>suet</ingredient> than to use all <ingredient>lard.</ingredient> Save all pieces of left-over <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> either raw or cooked, from <ingredient>steaks,</ingredient> roasts, <ingredient>bacon</ingredient> or <ingredient>ham.</ingredient> Cut all up into small pieces and place in a pan in the oven until tried out, or put in a double boiler and stand over <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> until <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is tried out. Strain and stand aside to be used as <ingredient>drippings.</ingredient> To clarify this <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> pour <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> over, let cook a short time, strain and stand away in a cool place, when a cake of solid <ingredient>fat</ingredient> will form on top, which may be readily removed and used as <ingredient>drippings,</ingredient> or it may be added to the kettle of <ingredient>fat</ingredient> used for deep frying. Always strain <ingredient>fat</ingredient> carefully after frying croquettes, fritters, etc. Should the frying <ingredient>fat</ingredient> become dark add to the can of <ingredient>soap fat</ingredient> the economical housewife is saving. Return the clear-strained <ingredient>fat</ingredient> to the cook pot, cover carefully, stand aside in a cool place, and the strained <ingredient>fat</ingredient> may be used times without number for frying. The housewife will find it very little trouble to fry fritters, croquettes, etc., in deep <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> if the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is always strained immediately after using, and returned to the cook pot, kept especially for this purpose. Stand on the hot range when required and the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> will heat in a few minutes, and if the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is the right temperature, food cooked in it should not be at all greasy. When the housewife is planning to fry fritters or croquettes she should, if possible, crumb the articles to be fried several hours before frying, and stand aside to become perfectly cold. When the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> for frying is so hot a blue smoke arises, drop in the fritters or croquettes, one at a time, in order not to chill the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> or plunge a frying basket, containing only a couple of fritters at a time, in the hot <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> as too many placed in the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> at one time lowers the temperature too quickly and causes the fritters to be greasy and soggy. To test the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> before dropping in the fritters, if a small piece of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is dropped in the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> and browns in about one minute the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is the right tem-perature for frying fritters, and fritters fried at the correct tem-perature should be a rich brown and at all greasy. When removing fritters from hot <ingredient>fat</ingredient> place on coarse brown <ingredient>paper</ingredient> to absorb any remaining <ingredient>fat.</ingredient> Fritters composed of vegetables, or <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> should be served on a platter garnished with <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> and<pb n="220" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=264"/> fritters composed of <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> should have pulverized <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> sifted over them liberally.

<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">PREPARATION OF <ingredient>SAVORY GRAVIES</ingredient></purpose> The art of preparing <ingredient>savory gravies</ingredient> and sauces is more important in connection with the serving of the cheaper <ingredient>meats</ingredient> than in connection with the cooking of the more expensive cuts.</p><p>There are a few general principles underlying the making of all sauces or <ingredient>gravies,</ingredient> whether the liquid used is <ingredient>water,</ingredient> <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> <ingredient>tomato juice</ingredient> or some combination of these. For ordinary <ingredient>gravy,</ingredient> 2 level table spoonfuls of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> or 1 1/2 tablespoonfuls of <ingredient>cornstarch,</ingredient> or arrow root, is sufficient to thicken a cup of liquid. This is true excepting in recipes where the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> is browned. In this case, about 1/2 tablespoonful more should be allowed, for <ingredient>browned flour</ingredient> does not thicken so well as unbrowned. The <ingredient>fat</ingredient> used may be <ingredient>butter</ingredient> or the <ingredient>drippings</ingredient> from the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> the allowance being 2 tablespoonfuls to a cup of liquid. The easiest way to mix the ingredients is to heat the <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> add the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and cook until the mixture ceases to bubble, and then to add the liquid. This is a quick method and by using it there is little danger of getting a lumpy <ingredient>gravy.</ingredient> Many persons, however, think it is not a wholesome method, and prefer the old-fashioned one of thickening the <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> by means of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> mixed with a little <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient> (Aunt Sarah was one who thought thus.) The latter method is not "practicable for brown <ingredient>gravies,</ingredient>" to quote the 



<emph rend="italic">Farmers' Bulletion</emph>.</p><p>The 



<emph rend="italic">Farmers' Bulletin</emph> further adds:</p><p>"Considering the large amount of discussion about the digestibility of fried food and of <ingredient>gravies</ingredient> made by heating <ingredient>flour</ingredient> in <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> a few words on the subject at this point may not be out of order. It is difficult to see how heating the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> before adding the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> can be unwholesome, unless the cook is unskillful enough to heat the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> so high that it begins to scorch. Overheated <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> as has already been pointed out, contains an acrid, irritating substance called 'Acrolein,' which may readily be considered to be unwholesome. It is without doubt the production of this body by overheating which has given fried food its bad name. There are several ways of varying the flavor of <ingredient>gravies</ingredient> and sauces. One should be especially mentioned here. The 



<emph rend="italic">flavor of <ingredient>browned flour</ingredient></emph>-The good flavor of <ingredient>browned flour</ingredient> is often overlooked.

<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading"><ingredient>BUTTER,</ingredient> <ingredient>CHEESE</ingredient> AND <ingredient>SUET</ingredient>-A SUBSTITUTE FOR <ingredient>BUTTER</ingredient></purpose> This formula for preparing a good, sweet, wholesome substitute for <ingredient>butter</ingredient> to be used for baking and frying was given Aunt Sarah by a thrifty German hausfrau, who prepared and used it in her large family many years. Aunt Sarah always kept a supply on hand. It was made as follows:</p><p><list><item>10 pounds of fine solid <ingredient>kidney suet.</ingredient></item><item>10 pounds of c<ingredient>lean pork fat.</ingredient></item><item>10 pounds of <ingredient>butter.</ingredient></item></list> The <ingredient>suet</ingredient> cut in small pieces was put in a large boiler of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> boiled until all was melted, and the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> extracted from the <ingredient>suet.</ingredient> It was then all poured through a fine sieve into 3 vessel containing <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> (the larger the quantity of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> the finer the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> will be). Stand aside to become cold and solid. The boiling process prevents the peculiar taste which 



<emph rend="italic">fried</emph> <ingredient>lard</ingredient> and <ingredient>suet</ingredient> usually possess. Treat the <ingredient>pork fat</ingredient> in a similar manner. Allow the <ingredient>suet</ingredient> and <ingredient>pork fat</ingredient> to stand until the following morning, when remove the solid <ingredient>fat</ingredient> from the boiler of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> wipe off all moisture and add both <ingredient>pork fat</ingredient> and <ingredient>suet fat</ingredient> to the melted <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> which had been prepared in the following manner: The <ingredient>butter</ingredient> was melted in a porcelain lined boiler and allowed to cook until all <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and other foreign substance had settled and the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> had the appearance of clear <ingredient>oil.</ingredient> At this point the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> should be watched carefully, as when settled it might quickly boil over, when you would be liable to lose your <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> besides suffering serious consequences. Now the liquid <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>suet</ingredient> and <ingredient>pork fat</ingredient> are all put together into a large boiler and allowed to melt together on the back part of the range. This will probably be done in the morning. After the noon meal is finished move the boiler containing <ingredient>fat</ingredient> to front part of range; let come to a boil, skimming it occasionally as it boils up. It needs close watching now, the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> being liable to cook over the top of boiler, when the "<ingredient>fat</ingredient>" would surely be "in the fire." Carefully pour into stone crock, and it may be kept for months in a cool place.<pb n="289" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=333"/> The <ingredient>fat</ingredient> which has been first poured off the top, if it has been carefully skimmed, will keep longest. The last taken from the boiler should be put in a stone crock to use first. This may be prepared in lesser quantities, or a smaller quantity of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> might be used to mix with the <ingredient>lard</ingredient> and <ingredient>suet.</ingredient> Although the preparation is to be preferred composed of equal quantities of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>lard</ingredient> and <ingredient>suet,</ingredient> adding <ingredient>milk</ingredient> to the first <ingredient>water</ingredient> in which the <ingredient>suet</ingredient> is boiled is quite an improvement. After filling the crocks with the <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> take the boiled-out <ingredient>suet</ingredient> and <ingredient>hard</ingredient> scraps and settlings of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> remaining and go through the same process and you will have a small jar of cooking <ingredient>fat</ingredient> for immediate use. A little trouble to do this, I admit, but one is well paid by having good, sweet, inexpensive cooking <ingredient>fat.</ingredient> I should advise a young housekeeper to experiment with one pound each of clarified <ingredient>suet</ingredient> and <ingredient>pork fat</ingredient> after it is rendered, and one pound of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> before attempting the preparation of a larger quantity.</p>

<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading"><ingredient>BUTTER</ingredient>-AS IT WAS MADE AT THE FARM, BY "AUNT SARAH"</purpose> Aunt Sarah strained fresh, <ingredient>sweet milk</ingredient> into small, brown earthenware crocks kept for this purpose, scrupulously clean. The crocks were kept in the spring-house or celler in summer (in cold weather the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> should be kept in a warmer place to allow <ingredient>cream</ingredient> to form on the top of the <ingredient>milk</ingredient>). When the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> was thick and sour she skimmed the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> from off the top of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> every day, stirring the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> well together every time she added fresh <ingredient>cream</ingredient> to that on hand. Aunt Sarah churned twice a week; <ingredient>sour cream</ingredient> should not be kept a longer time than one week. The churn was scalded with <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> then rinsed with <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> this prevented the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> adhering to the churn. The <ingredient>cream</ingredient> should be at a temperature of 60 degrees when put in the churn, but this would be almost too cold in Winter. In very hot weather the temperature of the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> should be 56 degrees. Aunt Sarah tested the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> with a small dairy tube thermometer. She churned steadily and usually had <ingredient>butter</ingredient> "come" in about 25 minutes, but should the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> be too cold or too warm it would be necessary to churn a longer time. If the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is too warm, stand vessel containing <ingredient>cream</ingredient> on ice; if too cold, stand in a warm place near the range. When the <ingredient>sour cream</ingredient><pb n="290" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=334"/> had been churned a certain length of time and granules of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> had formed, she drained off the <ingredient>buttermilk</ingredient> and poured <ingredient>water</ingredient> over the granules of <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> <ingredient>Water</ingredient> should be two degrees colder than the <ingredient>buttermilk.</ingredient> After churning a few minutes the lump of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> was removed from the chum, placed in a bowl, washed thoroughly several <ingredient>limes</ingredient> in very <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> until no <ingredient>buttermilk</ingredient> remained. The <ingredient>butter</ingredient> was worked thoroughly, with a wooden paddle, until all <ingredient>buttermilk</ingredient> had been extracted. One small tablespoonful of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> was added to each pound of <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> She worked the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> well, to incorporate the <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and molded it into shape. Aunt Sarah did not knead the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> but smoothed it down, then lifted it up from the large, flat, wooden bowl in which it was molded. When the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> was to be molded into 



<emph rend="italic">small shapes</emph>, she scalded the small wooden molds, then dipped them into <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> before using; this prevented the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> adhering to the molds. Before commencing to churn <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> Aunt Sarah was particular to have her hands scrupulously clean. All the utensils used were washed in <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> then rinsed in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> both hands and utensils. She frequently wrapped small pats of freshly-churned <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in small squares of clean cheese-cloth and placed in a stone crock with a cover. Placed in the crock was usually, with the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> a bunch of sweet clover blossoms, which imparted to the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> a delicious flavor.</p>

<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">USES OF "SWEET DRIPPINGS" AND <ingredient>SUET</ingredient></purpose> For deep frying Mary was taught to use <ingredient>lard</ingredient> and <ingredient>kidney suet</ingredient> combined. The latter had been tried out by cutting <ingredient>suet</ingredient> in small pieces. The <ingredient>suet,</ingredient> in an iron pan, was placed in a moderately hot oven until <ingredient>fat</ingredient> was tried out. To prevent <ingredient>suet</ingredient> when rendered having a taste of <ingredient>tallow,</ingredient> place in the upper part of boiler, over one containing <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> and stand on a hot range until all is tried out, or melted, instead of putting it in oven. Strain into a jar and stand aside in a cool place until wanted. Take one-third of this tried-out <ingredient>suet</ingredient> to two-thirds <ingredient>lard</ingredient> when frying croquettes, <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> cruellers or fritters. <ingredient>Suet</ingredient> contains food value equal to that of <ingredient>lard</ingredient> and food fried in this <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> combined with <ingredient>lard,</ingredient> is more wholesome than if fried in <ingredient>lard</ingredient> alone-if any food fried in <ingredient>fat</ingredient> ever is wholesome. And <ingredient>suet</ingredient> is more economical than <ingredient>lard</ingredient> if rendered at home. Mary was taught by her Aunt to save all the trimmings from <ingredient>steaks,</ingredient> <ingredient>fat</ingredient> left over from roasts, boiled <ingredient>ham,</ingredient> <ingredient>sausage,</ingredient> <ingredient>bacon fat,</ingredient> etc. When different fats have been tried out, to clarify them, add to every pound and a half of combined <ingredient>fat</ingredient> or <ingredient>drippings</ingredient> a half cup of <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> and a pinch of <ingredient>baking soda.</ingredient> Boil until wafer evaporates and <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is clear. Strain into a bowl and keep in a cool place. Clean, sweet <ingredient>drippings</ingredient> are preferred by most cooks to <ingredient>lard</ingredient> for many purposes. All young housewives do not know that <ingredient>ham</ingredient> or <ingredient>bacon fat</ingredient> may be substituted for half the <ingredient>shortening</ingredient> called for in many recipes for <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> cakes (where <ingredient>spices</ingredient> are used) with good results. Also that the <ingredient>grease</ingredient> rendered from c<ingredient>lean fat of chickens,</ingredient> which greatly resembles <ingredient>butter</ingredient> when tried out and cold, may be combined with an equal quantity of other <ingredient>shortening</ingredient> in making cakes in which <ingredient>spices</ingredient> are used. The difference in the taste of cake made from this <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> if rendered sweet and clean, will not be noticed. Equal parts of <ingredient>ham</ingredient> or <ingredient>bacon fat,</ingredient> <ingredient>pork</ingredient> chops or <ingredient>sausage fat,</ingredient> combined with <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> are excellent for frying <ingredient>cornmeal</ingredient> mush, <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> <ingredient>sweet potatoes,</ingredient> <ingredient>egg bread</ingredient> and <ingredient>calves</ingredient>' <ingredient>liver.</ingredient> Also<pb n="292" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=336"/> sliced <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> have a particularly fine flavor if fried in <ingredient>bacon fat.</ingredient> Should <ingredient>fat</ingredient> removed from top of <ingredient>stock</ingredient> pot have a flavor of vegetables, pour <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> over, strain and stand aside to cool; then remove the clean cake of <ingredient>fat</ingredient> on top of the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and add to howl of <ingredient>drippings.</ingredient> This is one of the small economies which will, I think, appeal to the frugal young housewife. If possible, procure an iron pot for deep frying. After using, strain the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> remaining, adding sediment in the bottom of cook-pot to the can of <ingredient>soap fat;</ingredient> then return the clean, strained <ingredient>fat</ingredient> to the cook pot.

She used the <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass in the proportion of 10 quarts of <ingredient>water</ingredient> to one pint of the <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass. The <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass, although in liquid form, is usually sold<pb n="296" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=340"/> by the pound, and 1 1/2 pounds equals one pint. The <ingredient>water</ingredient> should always be boiled and allowed to cool before combining with the <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass.</p><p>She was particular to use none but perfectly clean, fresh <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> She placed the <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> narrow end down, in an earthenware crock which had been well scalded and cooled.

So I do not see the need of using a large quantity of the <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass, although many recipes call for a mixture of one pint of <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass to only 8 quarts of <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p><p>Fresh <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> may be added daily until the crock is filled, having the mixture at least one inch above the last layer of <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> It is best not to wash the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> before packing, as this removes the natural mucilaginous coating on the outside of the shell. Place clean, fresh <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> carefully into the crock containing the <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass and <ingredient>water,</ingredient> with a long-handled spoon to avoid cracking the shell. Stand the crock containing <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> in a cool place, cover with a cloth tied over top of crock, avoiding frequent change of temperature; they should keep one year. The <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass solution may become cloudy, and resemble a soft-<ingredient>soap</ingredient> mixture, but this is a natural condition and does not affect the <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient></p><p>April is considered the best month for packing <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> Infertile <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> are to be preferred to others. Carefully remove the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> from the <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass mixture with a long-handled spoon when wanted to use, as the shells are sometimes not quite as <ingredient>hard</ingredient> as when placed in the crock. The <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> may he used for cooking, baking, in fact, for any purpose except soft-boiled, but should you wish to boil them, a tiny puncture should be made in the shell of these <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> before boiling.</p><p>Ten quarts of <ingredient>water</ingredient> to one pint of <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass will cover about 12 or 13 dozen <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient></p>

<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">CAKES-CAKE-MAKING</purpose> Sift <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>baking powder</ingredient> together several times before adding to cake batter. Aunt Sarah usually sifted <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>baking powder</ingredient> together four times for cakes. <ingredient>Flour</ingredient> should always be sifted before using. <ingredient>Baking powder</ingredient> should be sifted through the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> dry. Salaratus (or <ingredient>baking soda</ingredient>) should, usually, be dissolved before using in a teaspoonful of <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> unless stated otherwise. <ingredient>Cream of tartar</ingredient> should be sifted with the <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> <ingredient>Flour</ingredient> should be added gradually and batter stirred as little as possible afterwards, unless directions are given to<pb n="326" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=370"/> the contrary. Much beating after <ingredient>flour</ingredient> has been added is apt to make cake tough. Cake will be lighter if baked slowly at first. After it has raised increase heat slowly so it will brown nicely on top. The batter, if heated slowly, will rise evenly. This does not mean a cool oven. To prevent cakes sticking to pans, <ingredient>grease</ingredient> pans well with <ingredient>lard,</ingredient> and sift a little <ingredient>flour</ingredient> lightly over pan. Use <ingredient>baking powder</ingredient> with <ingredient>sweet milk.</ingredient> <ingredient>Saleratus</ingredient> is always used with <ingredient>sour milk.</ingredient> Use 1 teaspoonful of <ingredient>saleratus</ingredient> to 1 pint of <ingredient>sour milk.</ingredient> <ingredient>Cream of tartar</ingredient> and <ingredient>saleratus</ingredient> combined may be used with <ingredient>sweet milk</ingredient> instead of <ingredient>baking powder.</ingredient> One heaping teaspoonful of Royal <ingredient>baking powder</ingredient> is equivalent to 1 teaspoonful of <ingredient>cream of tartar</ingredient> and 1/2 teaspoonful of <ingredient>saleratus</ingredient> combined. Either <ingredient>baking powder</ingredient> or a combination of <ingredient>saleratus</ingredient> and <ingredient>cream of tartar</ingredient> may be used in a cake in which <ingredient>sweet milk</ingredient> is used. Usually take 1 1/2 to 2 scant teaspoonfuls of <ingredient>baking powder</ingredient> to two cups of <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> <ingredient>Saleratus</ingredient> should be used alone with <ingredient>sour milk.</ingredient> Put baking <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> in a stew-pan over fire and allow it to just come to boil; cool before using it. It will not sour as quickly in warm weather, and the cake baked from it will have a better flavor. The cup used in measuring ingredients for cakes holds exactly one-half pint. All cakes are improved by the addition of a pinch of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> When <ingredient>lard</ingredient> is used instead of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> beat to a <ingredient>cream</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> well. In mixing cakes, beat <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> together until light and creamy, then add the beaten <ingredient>yolks of eggs,</ingredient> unless stated otherwise as for angel cake, etc., then the flavoring, then mix in the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and liquid alternately. The <ingredient>baking powder,</ingredient> <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> should have been sifted together three or four times before being added. Lastly, fold in lightly the stiffly beaten <ingredient>whites of eggs.</ingredient> <ingredient>Fruit</ingredient> well dredged with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> should be added last, if used. Cool the oven if too hot for baking cakes by placing a pan containing <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> in the top rack of oven. Sponge cake particularly is improved by doing this, as it makes the cake moist. Stir sponge cake as little as possible after adding <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> as too much stirring then will make cake tough. Sift <ingredient>flour</ingredient> several times before using for sponge cake, as this causes the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> to become lighter. Layer cake, and most small cakes, require a quick oven. The oven door should not be opened for 12 minutes after cake has been placed in oven. Rich cakes, loaf cakes must bake long and slowly. The richer the cake, the slower the heat required in baking.<pb n="327" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=371"/> To test the oven, if the hand can <ingredient>bear</ingredient> the heat of the oven 20 or 25 seconds, the oven then is the right temperature. After placing a loaf cake in oven do not open the oven door for 20 minutes. If oven be not hot enough, the cake will rise, then fall and be heavy. Angel cake, sunshine cake and sponge cake require a moderate oven.</p><p><ingredient>Raisins</ingredient> and <ingredient>dried currants</ingredient> should be washed and dried before using in cake. All <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> should be dredged with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> before being added to cake. <ingredient>Citron</ingredient> may be quickly and easily prepared by cutting on a slaw cutter or it may be grated before being added to cake. When a recipe calls for <ingredient>butter</ingredient> the size of an <ingredient>egg</ingredient> it means two tablespoonfuls. A tablespoonful of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> melted, means the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> should be measured first, then melted. Aunt Sarah frequently used a mixture of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>lard</ingredient> in her cakes for economy's sake, and a lesser quantity may be used, as the <ingredient>shortening</ingredient> quality of <ingredient>lard</ingredient> is greater than that of <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> When substituting <ingredient>lard</ingredient> for <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> she always beat the <ingredient>lard</ingredient> to a <ingredient>cream</ingredient> before using it and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> it well. If <ingredient>raisins</ingredient> and <ingredient>currants</ingredient> are placed in oven of range a few minutes to become warmed before being added to cake, then rolled in <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> they will not sink to bottom of cake when baked.</p>

<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">ANGEL CAKE-AUNT SARAH'S RECIPE</purpose> >Mary was taught by her Aunt, when preparing a dish calling for <ingredient>yolks of eggs</ingredient> only, to place the <ingredient>white of eggs</ingredient> not used in a glass jar which she stood in a cold place or on ice. When she had saved one even cupful she baked an angel cake over the following recipe:</p><p>One heaping cup of pulverized <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> (all the cup will hold), was sifted 8 times. One cup of a mixture of <ingredient>pastry flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>corn starch</ingredient> (equal parts) was also sifted 8 times. The whole was then sifted together 4 times. The one cupful of <ingredient>white of eggs</ingredient> was beaten very stiff. When about half beaten, sprinkle over the partly-beaten <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> one scant teaspoonful of <ingredient>cream of tartar,</ingredient> then finish beating the <ingredient>whites of eggs.</ingredient> Flavor with <ingredient>almond or vanilla.</ingredient> Then carefully sift into the stiffly beaten <ingredient>whites of eggs sugar,</ingredient> <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>corn starch.</ingredient> Fold into the <ingredient>whites of eggs</ingredient> rather than stir. Aunt Sarah always baked this cake in a small, oblong <ingredient>bread</ingredient> pan. This cake should be baked in a 



<emph rend="italic">very</emph> moderate oven, one in which the hand might be held without inconvenience while counting one hundred; the oven should be just hot enough<pb n="336" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=380"/> for one to know there was fire in the range. Do not open the oven door for 15 minutes, then increase the heat a little; if not too hot, open the oven door a moment to cool and bake slowly for about 55 minutes.</p>

Be careful that the dough is not too moist. Press the dough with the hands into a lump, but do not knead. Take enough of the dough for one pie on the bake board, roll lightly, always in one direction, line greased pie tins and fill crust. If <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> pies, moisten the edge of the lower crust, cover with top crust, which has been rolled quite thin. A knife scraped across the top crust several times before placing over pie causes the crust to have a rough, flaky, rich-looking surface when baked.

<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">BUCKS COUNTY <ingredient>APPLE BUTTER</ingredient></purpose> A genuine old-fashioned recipe for <ingredient>apple butter,</ingredient> as "Aunt Sarah" made it at the farm. A large kettle holding about five gallons was filled with sweet <ingredient>cider.</ingredient> This eider was boiled down to half the quantity. The <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> was cooked over a wood fire, out of doors. The <ingredient>cider</ingredient> was usually boiled down the day before making the <ingredient>apple butter,</ingredient> as the whole process was quite a lengthy one. Fill the kettle holding the <ingredient>cider</ingredient> with <ingredient>apples,</ingredient> which should have been pared and cored the night before at what country folks call an "<ingredient>apple</ingredient> bee," the neighbors assisting to expedite the work. The <ingredient>apples</ingredient> should be put on to cook as early in the morning as possible and cooked slowly over not too hot a fire, being stirred constantly with a long-handled "stirrer" with small perforated piece of wood on one end. There is great danger of the <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> burning if not carefully watched and constantly stirred. An extra pot of boiling <ingredient>cider</ingredient> was kept near, to add to the <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> as the <ingredient>cider</ingredient> boiled away. If cooked slowly, a whole day or longer will be consumed in cooking. When the <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> had almost finished cooking, about the last hour, sweeten to taste with <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> (<ingredient>brown sugar</ingredient> was frequently used). <ingredient>Spices</ingredient> destroy the true <ingredient>apple</ingredient> flavor, although Aunt Sarah used <ingredient>sassafras root,</ingredient> dug from the near-by woods, for flavoring her <ingredient>apple butter,</ingredient> and it was unexcelled. The <ingredient>apple butter,</ingredient> when cooked sufficiently, should be a dark rich color, and thick like <ingredient>marmalade,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>cider</ingredient> should not separate from it when a small quantity is tested on a saucer. An old recipe at the farm called for 32 gallons of <ingredient>cider</ingredient> to 8 buckets of <ingredient>cider apples,</ingredient> and to 40 gallons of <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> 50 pounds of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> were used. Pour the <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> in small crocks used forthis purpose. Cover the top of crocks with <ingredient>paper,</ingredient> place in dry, cool store-room, and the <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> will keep several years. In olden times sweet <ingredient>apples</ingredient> were used for <ingredient>apple butter,</ingredient> boiled in sweet <ingredient>cider,</ingredient> then no <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> was necessary. Small brown, earthen pots were used to keep this <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> in, it being only necessary to tie <ingredient>paper</ingredient> over the top. Dozens of these pots, filled with <ingredient>apple butter,</ingredient> might have been seen in Aunt Sarah's store-room at the farm at one time.</p>

<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">CANNED TOMATOES</purpose> When canning <ingredient>red tomatoes</ingredient> select those which ripen early<pb n="405" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=449"/> in the season, as those which ripen later are usually not as sweet. Wash the tomateos, pour scalding <ingredient>water</ingredient> over, allow them to stand a short time, when <ingredient>skins</ingredient> may be easily removed. Cut <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> in several pieces, place over fire in porcelain-lined preserving kettle, and cook about 25 minutes, or until an <ingredient>orange</ingredient>-colored scum risees to the top. Fill perfectly clean sterilized jars with the hot <ingredient>tomatoes,</ingredient> fill quickly before they cool. Place rubber and top on jar, and when jars have become perfectly cold (although they may, apparently, have been perfectly air-tight), the tops should be given another turn before standing away for the Winter; failing to do this has frequently been the cause of inexperienced housewives' ill success when canning <ingredient>tomatoes.</ingredient> Also run the edge of a knife blade carefully around the top of the jar, pressing down the outer edge and causing it to fit more closely. Aunt Sarah seldom lost a jar of canned <ingredient>tomatoes,</ingredient> and they were as fine flavored as if freshly picked from the vines. She was very particular about using only new tops and rubbers for her jars when canning <ingredient>tomatoes.</ingredient> If the wise housewife takes these precautions, her canned <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> should keep indefinitely. Aunt Sarch allowed her jars of <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> to stand until the day following that on which the <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> were canned, to be positively sure they were cold, before giving the tops a final turn. Stand away in a dark closet.</p>

<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">ICE <ingredient>CREAM</ingredient> MADE BY BEATING WITH PADDLE</purpose> This recipe for a delicious and easily prepared ice <ingredient>cream</ingredient> was given Mary by a friend living in Philadelphia and is not original. She found the ice <ingredient>cream</ingredient> excellent and after having tried the recipe used no other. A custard was made of 1 quart of scalded <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> 6 <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> 3 cups of <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient> The <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> were beaten light, then <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> was added, then the hot <ingredient>milk</ingredient> was poured over and all beaten together. She put all in a double boiler and stirred about ten minutes, until thick and creamy. A small pinch of <ingredient>soda</ingredient> was added to prevent curdling. When the custard was perfectly cold she stirred in three cups of sweet, cold <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> flavored with either <ingredient>vanilla</ingredient> or <ingredient>almond flavoring</ingredient>, and beat all together five minutes, then turned the mixture into the freezer, packed well with pounded ice and <ingredient>coarse salt.</ingredient> She covered the freezer with the ice and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and threw a heavy piece of old carpet or burlap over the freezer to exclude the air. She let it stand one hour, then carefully opened the can containing the <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> not allowing any <ingredient>salt</ingredient> to get in the can. With a long, thin-bladed knife she scraped down the frozen custard from the sides of the freezer, and with a thin wooden paddle beat it <ingredient>hard</ingredient> and fast for about five minutes. This made the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> fine and smooth. Any <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> may now be added, and should be mixed in before the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is covered. The <ingredient>cream</ingredient> should be beaten quickly as possible and covered as soon as the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> has been added.

Fine, ripe <ingredient>peaches</ingredient> were pared and pitted, then finely mashed, 2 small cups of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> being added to a pint of mashed <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient>. She allowed this <ingredient>peach</ingredient> mixture to stand one hour before adding to the <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> she fastened the lid and drained off part of the <ingredient>water</ingredient> in outer vessel, packed more ice and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> about the can in the freezer,<pb n="410" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=454"/> placed a weight on top to hold it down, covered closely with a piece of old carpel to exclude the air, left it stand three or four hours.

<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">A SUBSTITUTE FOR <ingredient>MAPLE SYRUP</ingredient></purpose> A very excellent substitute for <ingredient>maple syrup</ingredient> to serve on hot griddle cakes is prepared from 2 pounds of either brown or <ingredient>white sugar</ingredient> and 1 3/4 cups of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> in the following manner: Place the stew-pan containing <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and <ingredient>water</ingredient> on the back part of range, until <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> dissolves, then boil from 10 to 15 minutes, until the mixture thickens to the consistency of <ingredient>honey.</ingredient> Remove from the range and add a few drops of <ingredient>vanilla</ingredient> or "mapleine" flavoring.

Put a small quantity of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> into a pan. When hot, throw in the <ingredient>nuts</ingredient> and stir for a few minutes, sprinkle a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> over.

<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading"><ingredient>PEANUT BUTTER</ingredient></purpose> When <ingredient>peanuts</ingredient> have been blanched, are cold, dry and crisp, run them through a food chopper. Do not use the 



<emph rend="italic">very finest</emph> cutter, as that makes a soft mass. Or they may be crushed with a rolling pin.

Or run <ingredient>peanuts</ingredient> through food chopper which has an extra fine cutter especially for this purpose. The <ingredient>peanuts</ingredient> are then a thick, creamy mass. Thin this with a small quantity of <ingredient>olive oil,</ingredient> or melted <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> if preferred. Season with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and you have "<ingredient>peanut butter,</ingredient>" which, spread on slices of buttered <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> makes a delicious sandwich, and may frequently take the place of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> sandwiches. <ingredient>Nuts,</ingredient> when added to salads, <ingredient>bread</ingredient> or cake, add to their food value.</p>
