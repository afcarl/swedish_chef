<recipe class1="breadsweets" region="south"><p><purpose rend="italic">Beaten Biscuit:</purpose>



(Old Style.) Sift a quart of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into a bowl or tray, add half a teaspoon <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> then cut small into it a teacup of very <ingredient>cold lard.</ingredient> Wet with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient>--<ingredient>ice water</ingredient> is best--into a very stiff<pb n="29" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=33"/> dough. Lay on a floured block, or marble slab, and give one hundred strokes with a mallet or rolling pin. Fold afresh as the dough beats thin, dredging in <ingredient>flour</ingredient> if it begins to stick. The end of beating is to distribute air well through the mass, which, expanding by the heat of baking, makes the biscuit light. The dough should be firm, but smooth and very elastic. Roll to half-inch thickness, cut out with a small <implement>round cutter,</implement> prick lightly all over the top, and bake in steady heat to a delicate brown. Too hot an oven will scorch and blister, too cold an one make the biscuit hard and clammy. Aim for the Irishman's "middle exthrame."</p></recipe>

at once. The trouble is hardly increased, and the results, especially in saving, very much greater. The head will have been at least half severed in slaughtering. With a very sharp <implement>butcher knife,</implement> after the <ingredient>pig</ingredient> is laid on the chopping block, cut deeply through the<pb n="41" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=45"/> skin, all round, then with a blow or two of the axe sever the head. Next cut through the skin deeply, either side of the back bone. The cuts should be evenly parallel, and about two inches apart. Now turn the <ingredient>pig</ingredient> on his back, part the legs and with the <implement>meat axe</implement> chop through the ribs, and joints. After chopping, cut the backbone free with the knife, trim off the strip of fat for the lard pile, chop the backbone itself into pieces three to four inches long, until the chine is reached--the part betwixt the shoulder blades with the high spinal processes. Leave the chine intact for smoking, along with the jowls and sausage.</p><p>Pull out the leaf-fat--it grows around and over the kidneys. Also pull out the spare ribs, leaving only one or two in the shoulders. This done, chop off feet, then with the knife cut hams and shoulders free from the sides. Trim after cutting out, saving all trimmings for sausage. Save every bit of pure fat for lard. Also cut away the clear fat at the top of the sides, devoting it to the same use. Make clean cuts on the joints--this means a knife often<pb n="42" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=46"/> whetted. Trim the hams rather flat, and shape the hip bone neatly. The commercial fashion of cutting away all the upper half of hams is fatal to perfect flavor. Trim shoulders close, unless they are destined to be made into sausage--in that case put them with the other scraps. Sides can either be cut into strips four to five inches wide the long way, after the manner of commercial "breakfast bacon," or left whole throughout their streaky part, cutting away solid fat along the top for lard. Separate the heads at the jaw, leaving the tongue attached to the jowl, and taking care not to cut it. Cut off the snout two inches above the tip, then lay the upper part of the head, skin down, crack the inner bone with the axe, press the broken bones apart, and take out the brains. Jowls are to be salted and smoked--heads are best either simply corned for boiling with cabbage, peas, beans, etc., or made in conjunction with the feet into head-cheese, whose south country name is souse.</p><p>Use regular <ingredient>pickling salt</ingredient>--coarse-grained and lively. Spread it an inch<pb n="43" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=47"/> thick upon clean wood--a broad shelf, box bottom, or something similar. Rub the meat well over with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and then lay it neatly, skin-side down, upon the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> layer, spread more <ingredient>salt</ingredient> on top, and put on another layer of meat. Put sides together, likewise hams and shoulders. Pack as close as possible and fill all crevices with <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> <ingredient>Salt</ingredient> alone will save your bacon, but a teacup of <ingredient>moist sugar</ingredient> well mixed through a water-bucket of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> improves the flavor. Use this on sides, jowls and chines. The joints, hams and shoulders, especially if the shoulders are close-cut, need a trifle more <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> in the <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> also a trifle of saltpeter--say an ounce in fine powder to three gallons of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Rub the skin-sides over with plain <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and lay upon the salt-covered shelf the same as sides. Then take a handful of the mixture and rub it in hard around the bone, then cover the whole cut surface half an inch thick, spread on dry <ingredient>salt</ingredient> for another layer of hams or shoulders, and repeat. Salt the chines lightly--their surface, cut all over, takes up too much <ingredient>salt</ingredient> if permitted. There should be holes<pb n="44" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=48"/> or cracks in the bottom to let the dissolved <ingredient>salt</ingredient> drip away; it is best also to have it a foot at least above the floor.</p><p>Cover the meat thus in bulk, but not too close, and leave standing a fortnight. The cooler and airier the place it stands in the better--freezing even is not objectionable when the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> begins striking in. But with freezing weather the meat must lie longer in <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Overhaul it after the first fortnight--that is to say break up the bulk, shake away bloody <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> sweep the bottom clean, and put on fresh <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> But use very little saltpeter on the joints this time--on pain of making them too hard as to their lean. Its use is to give firmness and a handsome clear red color--an overdose of it produces a faintly undesirable flavor. Some famous ham makers, at this second salting, rub the cut sides over lightly with very good <ingredient>molasses,</ingredient> and sprinkle on <ingredient>ground black pepper,</ingredient> before adding new <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Others rub in a teaspoonful of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> mixed with pounded <ingredient>red pepper</ingredient> around the bone. But very excellent hams can be made without such excess of painstaking.</p><pb n="45" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=49"/><p>Let the meat lie two to four weeks after overhauling, according to the weather. Take up, wipe all over with coarse clean cloth, furnish each piece with a loop of stout twine at least four inches long, and so run through the flesh, tearing out is impossible. Run through the hock of hams, the upper tip of shoulders, the thickest part of sides, the pointed tip of jowls. Jowls may not need to lie so long as bigger pieces, especially if part of their fat has gone to lard. Chines can be hung up in three weeks, and cured with a very light smoking, along with the bags of sausage.</p><p>Hang hams highest, shoulders next, then sides, jowls, etc. Leave to drip forty-eight hours unless the weather turns suddenly warm, damp and muggy--in that case start the smoking after a few hours. Smoke from green hickory, sound and bright, is needed for the finest flavor. Lay small logs so they will hug together as they burn, kindle fire along the whole length of them, then smother it with damp, small chips, trash, bark and so on, but take care to have everything sound. Rotten<pb n="46" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=50"/> wood, or that which is water-logged or mildewed, makes rank, ill-smelling smoke. Take greater care that the logs never blaze up, also that the meat is high enough to escape fire-heating. Once it gets hot from the fire all your trouble will have been for naught--though it will not be tainted it will have the same taste and smell--the degree marking the extent of the heating.</p></recipe>

Then go all over the <ingredient>ham</ingredient> with a dull knife, scraping off every bit of removable grease or soilure.<pb n="60" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=64"/> Wipe afterward with a coarse, damp cloth, then lay in a dishpan and cover an inch deep with <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient> If the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is very hard soften by adding a tiny pinch of <ingredient>baking soda.</ingredient> Leave in soak all night. In the morning wash well all over, using your coarse cloth, and a little scouring soap, then rinse well in <ingredient>tepid water,</ingredient> followed by a second rinsing in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> drain, and wipe dry. A flat-bottomed <implement>boiler</implement> is best--with one rounding, there is greater risk of scorching. Set a rack on the bottom else an old dish or earthen pieplate, pour in an inch of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> set over the fire, lay the <ingredient>ham</ingredient> upon the rack, skin side down, and fill up with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> till it stands two inches above the meat. Take care in adding the <ingredient>water</ingredient> not to dislodge the <ingredient>ham</ingredient> from the rack. Bring the <ingredient>water</ingredient> to a boil, throw in a pint of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and skim the <implement>boiler</implement> very clean, going over it twice or three times. After the last skimming add half a dozen whole <ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> a dozen whole <ingredient>alspice,</ingredient> a pod of <ingredient>red pepper,</ingredient> a few whole grains of <ingredient>black pepper,</ingredient> and if you like, a young <ingredient>onion</ingredient> or a stalk of <ingredient>celery.</ingredient> Personally<pb n="61" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=65"/> I do not like either <ingredient>onion</ingredient> or <ingredient>celery</ingredient>--moreover they taint the fat one may save from the pot. Let the <ingredient>water</ingredient> boil hard for half a minute, no longer, then slack heat till it barely simmers. Keep it simmering, filling up the pot as the <ingredient>water</ingredient> in it boils away, until the <ingredient>ham</ingredient> is tender throughout. The time depends on several things--the hardness and age of the <ingredient>ham,</ingredient> weight, curing. Fifteen minutes to the pound, reckoned from the beginning of simmering, is the standard allowance. I have no hard and fast rule--my <ingredient>hams</ingredient> boil always until the fork pierces them readily, and the hipbone stands clear of flesh.</p><p>A big <ingredient>ham,</ingredient> fifteen to twenty pounds weight, had better be left in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> overnight. A smaller one, say of ten pounds weight, should remain only until thoroughly cold. Take up carefully when cold, let drain twenty minutes, lying flesh side up in a flat dish, then trim off the under side and edges neatly, removing rusty fat, strings, etc., and cutting through the skin at the hock end. Turn over and remove the skin--taking care not to tear<pb n="62" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=66"/> away too much fat with it. Remove the <ingredient>ham</ingredient> to a clean, deep dish, or bowl--the closer fitting the better, then pour around it either sound <ingredient>claret,</ingredient> or <ingredient>sweet cider,</ingredient> till it stands half way up the sides. Add a little <ingredient>tabasco</ingredient> or <ingredient>Worcester</ingredient> to the liquor, if high flavors are approved. Then stick whole <ingredient>cloves</ingredient> in a lozenge pattern all over the fat, sprinkle on thickly <ingredient>red and black pepper,</ingredient> and last of all, <ingredient>sugar</ingredient>--<ingredient>brown sugar</ingredient> if to be had, but white will do.</p><p>Leave standing several hours, basting once or twice with the liquor in the bowl. Take out, set on a rack in an <implement>agate pan,</implement> pour the liquor underneath, and bake slowly one to two hours, according to size. Baste every fifteen minutes, adding <ingredient>water</ingredient> as the liquor cooks away. Beware scorching--the <ingredient>ham</ingredient> should be a beautiful speckly dark brown all over. Let cool uncovered, and keep cool, but not on ice until eaten.</p><p>Drop a lump of <ingredient>ice</ingredient> in the boiling liquor unless the weather is cold--then set it outside. As soon as the fat on top hardens take it off, boil it fifteen minutes in clear <ingredient>water,</ingredient> chill, skim off, and clarify by<pb n="63" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=67"/> frying slices of raw <ingredient>potato</ingredient> in it. The spices will have sunk to the bottom, and there will be no trace of their flavor in the fat. Any boiling vegetable--cabbage, string beans, navy beans, greens in general--may be cooked to advantage in the liquor. It also serves as an excellent foundation for pea soup. Drain it off from the sediment, reduce a trifle by quick boiling, then add the other things. Dumplings of sound cornmeal, wet up stiff, shaped the size of an egg, and dropped in the boiling liquor, furnish a luncheon dish cheap and appetizing.</p></recipe>

as Mammy made it is mostly a fragrant memory--only plutocrats dare indulge in it these days. She cut thin slices from the juicy, thick part of the <ingredient>ham,</ingredient> using a very sharp, clean knife. Then she trimmed away the skin, and laid the slices in a clean, hot skillet--but not too hot. In about a minute she flipped them over delicately, so as to sear the other side. When enough fat had been tried out to bubble a bit, she turned them again, then set the skillet off, deadened the coals beneath it<pb n="64" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=68"/> a little--put it back, and let the <ingredient>ham</ingredient> cook until tender through and through. She never washed the slices nor even wiped them with damp cloths. There was no need--her hands and knife were as clean as could be. Washing and wiping spoiled the flavor, she said. I agree with her.

Skim away all froth, and cook for an hour, keeping the kettle barely boiling. It should reduce about one-half. Take from the fire and add spirits, either <ingredient>whiskey</ingredient> or <ingredient>brandy,</ingredient> in the proportion of one to two--two pints cordial to one of liquor.

Troublesome, but worth the trouble. Wash dead-ripe <ingredient>muscadines,</ingredient> and pop them one by one, out of the skins.

Any sort of acid <ingredient>fruit</ingredient>--as <ingredient>strawberries,</ingredient> <ingredient>raspberries,</ingredient> <ingredient>gooseberries,</ingredient> <ingredient>currants, black or red,</ingredient> affords a refreshing drink.

Keep over the <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> stirring well together as you fill the <ingredient>tart</ingredient> shells. They must be lined with real <ingredient>puff paste,</ingredient> rolled very thin, and nicely fitted.

While time endures New Orleans will plume itself upon this dish which drew from Thackeray a world-famous tribute. "In New Orleans you can eat a Bouillabaisse, the like of which was never eaten in Marseilles or Paris." Which is much, very much, from the laureate of Bouillabaisse, as native to Marseilles. The reason of superiority is not far to seek--it lies in the excellence and flavor of the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> native to the Gulf of Mexico. Lacking <ingredient>Pompano,</ingredient> <ingredient>Red Snapper,</ingredient> and <ingredient>Redfish,</ingredient> even Milly could not quite do her knowledge justice. But she made shift with what the market offered, choosing generally <ingredient>halibut,</ingredient> with fresh <ingredient>cod,</ingredient> or <ingredient>bluefish,</ingredient> or <ingredient>sea trout.</ingredient> Two kinds of <ingredient>fish</ingredient> in equal quantity are imperative. The better, finer and firmer the <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> the better<pb n="123" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=127"/> the Bouillabaisse.

In sandwich making mind your <emph rend="italic">S's.</emph> That is to say, have your knife sharp, your <ingredient>bread</ingredient> stale, your butter soft.<pb n="216" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=220"/> Moreover the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> must be specially made--fine grained, firm, not crumbly, nor ragged. Cut off crusts for ordinary sandwiches--but if shaping them with cutters let it stay. Then you can cut to the paper-thinness requisite--otherwise that is impossible. Work at a roomy table spread with a clean old tablecloth over which put sheets of clean, thick paper. Do your cutting on the papered surface--thus you save either turning your knife edges against a platter or sorely gashing even an old cloth. Keep fancy cutters all together and ready to your hand. Shape one kind of sandwiches all the same--thus you distinguish them easily. Make as many as your paper space will hold, before stamping out any--this saves time and strength. Clear away the fragments from one making, before beginning another sort, thus avoiding possible taints and confusion. Lay your made sandwiches on a platter under a dry cloth with a double damp one on top of it. They will not dry out, and it is much easier than wrapping in oiled paper.</p><p><variation>The nearer fillings approach the consistency<pb n="217" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=221"/> of soft butter, the better.

All the real Java and Mocha in the world is snapped up, long before it filters down to the average level. Back in the Dark Ages of my childhood, I knew experimentally real Java--we got it by the sack-full straight from New Orleans--and called the Rio coffee used by many of our neighbors "Seed tick coffee," imagining its flavor was like the smell of those pests. Nowadays, Rio coffee has pretty well the whole world for its parish. Wherefore the best one can do, is to get it sound, well roasted, and as fresh as may be. Much as I love and practice home preparation, I am willing to let the Trust or who will, roast my coffee. Roasting is parlous work, hot, tedious, and tiresome, also mighty apt to result in scorching if not burning. One last caution--never meddle with the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> unless sure your hand is light, your memory so trustworthy you will not put it in twice.</p><p><variation><purpose>Chocolate</purpose>



spells <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> and <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> and trouble, hence I make it only on occasions of high state. Yet--I am said to make<pb n="238" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=242"/> it well. Perhaps the secret lies in the <ingredient>brandy</ingredient>--a scant teaspoonful for each cake of <ingredient>chocolate</ingredient> grated. Put in a bowl after grating, add the <ingredient>brandy,</ingredient> stir about, then add enough <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> to dissolve smoothly, and stir into a quart of <ingredient>rich milk,</ingredient> just brought to a boil. Add six lumps of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> stir till dissolved, pour into your pot, which must have held <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> for five minutes previously, and serve in heated cups, with or without <ingredient>whipped cream</ingredient> on top. There is no taste of the <ingredient>brandy</ingredient>--it appears merely to give a smoothness to the blending. If the <ingredient>chocolate</ingredient> is too rich, half-fill cups with <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> then pour in the <ingredient>chocolate.</ingredient> There are brands of <ingredient>chocolate</ingredient> which can be made wholly of <ingredient>water</ingredient>--they will serve at a pinch, but are not to be named with the real thing. Cocoa I have never made, therefore say nothing about its making. Like Harry Percy's wife, in cooking at least, I "never tell that which I do not know."</variation></p></recipe>

<purpose>peach butter.</purpose>



It began in cider--the <ingredient>cider from fall apples,</ingredient> very rich and sweet. To boil it down properly required a battery of brass kettles swung over a log fire in the yard, the same as at drying up lard time. Naturally brass kettles were at a premium--but luckily everybody did not make peach butter, so it was no strain upon neighborly comity to borrow of such. It took more than half a day to boil down the <ingredient>cider</ingredient> properly--kettles were filled up constantly as there was room. By and by, when the contents became almost syrup, <ingredient>peaches</ingredient> went in--preferably the late, soft, white ones, dead ripe, very juicy, and nearly as sweet as sugar. After the kettles were full<pb n="247" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=251"/> of them, peeled and halved, of course, the boiling went on until the fruit was mushy. Constant stirring helped to make it so. Fresh <ingredient>peaches</ingredient> were added twice, and cooked down until the paddle stood upright in the middle of the kettle. Then came the spicing--putting in <ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> <ingredient>mace,</ingredient> bruised <ingredient>ginger,</ingredient> and <ingredient>alspice</ingredient>--sparingly, but enough to flavor delicately. <variation>If the <ingredient>white peaches</ingredient> ran short, there might be a supplemental butter-making when the <ingredient>Red Octobers</ingredient> came in, at the very last of the month. They were big and handsome, oval, with the richest crimson cheeks, but nothing like so sweet as the white ones. So <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> or <ingredient>honey,</ingredient> was added scantily, at the end of the boiling down. If it had been put in earlier, it would have added to the danger of burning.</variation></p></recipe>



<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans" class2="accompaniments" region="south"><p>Proper stewing meant washing a quart of <ingredient>dry fruit</ingredient> in two waters, soaking overnight, then putting over the fire in the soaking <ingredient>water,</ingredient> covering with a plate to hold the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> down, and simmering at the least five hours, filling up the kettle from time to time, and adding after the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> was soft a pound of <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient> Then at the very last <ingredient>spices</ingredient> to taste went in.

<purpose>boiled custard</purpose>--which was much higher in favor, being easier made, and quite as showy. For it you beat very light the <ingredient>yolks of twelve eggs</ingredient> with four cups <ingredient>white sugar,</ingredient> added them to a gallon of <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> and a quart of <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> in a brass kettle over the fire, stirred the mixture steadily, watching it close to remove it just as it was on the point of boiling, let it cool, then flavored it well, with either <ingredient>whiskey,</ingredient> <ingredient>brandy,</ingredient> or <ingredient>sweet wine.</ingredient> Meantime the <ingredient>egg-whites</ingredient> beaten with a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> until they stuck to the dish, had been cooked by pouring quickly over them <ingredient>full-boiling water</ingredient> from a tea kettle.

I wouldn't believe them tales ef Angel Gabriel come down and told 'em to me."</p></recipe>



<recipe class1="meatfishgame" region="south"><p>There was 



 



<purpose>barbecue,</purpose>



and again there were barbecues. The viand is said to get its name from the French phrase <emph rend="italic">a barbe d' ecu,</emph> from tail to head, signifying that the carcass was cooked whole. The derivation may be an early example of making the punishment fit the crime. As to that I do not know. What I do know is that <ingredient>lambs,</ingredient> <ingredient>pigs,</ingredient> and <ingredient>kids,</ingredient> when barbecued, are split in half along the backbone. The animals, butchered at sundown, and cooled of animal heat, after washing down well, are laid upon clean, split sticks of green wood over a trench two feet deep, and a little wider, and as long as need be, in which green wood has previously been burned to coals. There the meat stays twelve hours--from midnight to noon next day, usually. It is basted steadily with <ingredient>salt water,</ingredient> applied with a clean mop, and turned over once only. Live coals are added as needed from the log fire kept burning a little way off. All this sounds simple, dead-easy. Try it--it is really an art. The plantation barbecuer was a person of consequence--moreover, few plantations could show a<pb n="274" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=278"/> master of the art. Such an one could give himself lordly airs--the loan of him was an act of special friendship--profitable always to the personage lent. Then as now there were free barbecuers, mostly white--but somehow their handiwork lacked a little of perfection. For one thing, they never found out the exact secret of "dipney," the sauce that savored the meat when it was crisply tender, brown all over, but free from the least scorching.</p></recipe>



<recipe class1="accompaniments" region="south"><p>Daddy made it thus: Two pounds <ingredient>sweet lard,</ingredient> melted in a brass kettle, with one pound beaten, not ground, <ingredient>black pepper,</ingredient> a pint of small fiery <ingredient>red peppers,</ingredient> nubbed and stewed soft in <ingredient>water</ingredient> to barely cover, a spoonful of <ingredient>herbs</ingredient> in powder--he would never tell what they were,--and a quart and pint of the strongest <ingredient>apple vinegar,</ingredient> with a little <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> These were simmered together for half an hour, as the barbecue was getting done. Then a fresh, clean mop was dabbed lightly in the mixture, and as lightly smeared over the upper sides of the carcasses. Not a drop was permitted to fall on the coals--it would have sent up<pb n="275" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=279"/> smoke, and films of light ashes. Then, tables being set, the meat was laid, hissing hot, within clean, tight wooden trays, deeply gashed upon the side that had been next the fire, and deluged with the

which the mop-man smeared fully over it.</p></recipe>



<recipe class1="meatfishgame" region="south"><p>After dinner one went to the dressing-room, a wide roofless space enclosed with green boughs massed on end, and furnished plentifully with water in buckets, towels, basins, pin cushions, combs and brushes, face powder, even needles and thread. Thence one emerged after half an hour quite fresh--to dance on and on, till the fiddlers played a fast finale, and went to<pb n="284" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=288"/> their supper. Then came an interval of talk and laughing, of making new friends or stabbing delicately old enemies. Also and further much primping in the dressing-room. Dancing steadily through a temperature of 98 in the shade plays hob with some sorts of prettiness. But as dew fell and lighted lanterns went up about the arbor and throughout the grove, supper was very welcome. There was hot coffee for everybody, likewise milk, likewise lemonade, with buttered biscuit, chicken, ham, and barbecue. 



 



<purpose>Chicken-loaf</purpose>



was particularly good for such uses. To make it, several plump, tender, full-grown <ingredient>pullets</ingredient> were simmered in <ingredient>water</ingredient> to barely cover them, with a few <ingredient>pepper corns,</ingredient> half a dozen <ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> and a blade of <ingredient>mace,</ingredient> until very, very tender. Then the meat was picked from the bones, cut up while still hot, packed down in something deep, seasoning it to taste with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> as it was packed, and dusting in more <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> if needed, then the liquor which had been kept at a brisk boil was poured over, and left to cool. No bother about skimming off fat--we liked<pb n="285" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=289"/> our loaf rich as well as high-flavored. It came out a fine mottled solid that could be sliced thin, and eaten delicately between the halves of a buttered biscuit. Sandwiches were known--but only in books. Which was well--they would have dried out so badly, for this was before the era of wax paper. Since everything was packed in the baskets whole, there was much work for mothers and Mammies at the unpacking and table-setting.</p></recipe>



<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans"><p>Only epicures dressed their

<attribution>(Dorothy Dix.)</attribution> As refined gold can be gilded, barbecue, common, or garden variety, can take on extra touches. As thus: Kill and dress quickly a fine yearling <ingredient>wether,</ingredient> in prime condition but not over-fat, sluice out with cool <ingredient>water,</ingredient> wipe dry inside and out with a soft, damp cloth, then while still hot, fill the carcass cram-full of fresh <ingredient>mint,</ingredient> the tenderer and more lush the better, close it, wrap tight in a clean cloth wrung very dry from cold <ingredient>salt water,</ingredient> then pop all into a clean, bright tin <implement>lard stand,</implement> with a tight-fitting top, put on top securely, and sink the stand head over ears in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient>--a spring if possible. Do this around dusk and leave in <ingredient>water</ingredient> until very early morning. Build fire in trench of hard wood logs before two o'clock. Let it burn to coals--have a log fire some little way off to supply fresh coals at need. Lay a breadth of galvanized chicken-wire--large<pb n="291" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=295"/> mesh--over the trench. Take out carcass--split it half down back bone, lay it flesh side down, on the wire grid, taking care coals are so evenly spread there is no scorching. After an hour begin basting with "the sop." It is made thus. Best <ingredient>butter</ingredient> melted, one pound, <ingredient>black pepper</ingredient> ground, quarter pound, <ingredient>red pepper</ingredient> pods, freed of stalk and cut fine to almost a paste, half a pint, strong <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> scant pint, <ingredient>brandy, peach if possible though apple or grape will answer,</ingredient> half a pint. Cook all together over very slow heat or in <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> for fifteen minutes. The sop must not scorch, but the seasoning must be cooked through it. Apply with a big soft swab made of clean old linen, but not old enough to fray and string. Baste meat constantly. Put over around four in the morning, the barbecue should be done, and well done, by a little after noon. There should be enough sop left to serve as gravy on portions after it is helped. The meat, turned once, has a fine crisped surface, and is flavored all through with the <ingredient>mint,</ingredient> and seasoning.</p></recipe>
