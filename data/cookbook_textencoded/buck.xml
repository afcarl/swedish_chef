<purpose align="center" placement="heading">THE SPONGE.</purpose>



This is made from <ingredient>warm water or milk,</ingredient> <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> and <ingredient>flour</ingredient> <variation>(some add <ingredient>mashed potatoes),</ingredient></variation> mixed together in proper proportions. In summer, care must be taken not to set sponge too early, at least not before eight or nine o'clock in the evening. Make up a rather thick batter of flour and <ingredient>tepid water or milk.</ingredient> (Sponge mixed with <ingredient>bran water,</ingredient> warm in winter and cold in summer, makes sweeter bread. Boil bran in the proportion of one pint to a quart of <ingredient>water</ingredient> and strain.) <variation>When <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is used, scald to prevent souring, and cool before using;</variation> add yeast, cover closely, and place to rise on the kitchen table. <variation>In very hot weather, sponge can be made with <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient></variation> <variation>In winter, mix the batter with <ingredient>water or milk at blood warmth,</ingredient> testing it with the finger, and making it as warm as can be borne; stir in the flour, which will cool it sufficiently for the yeast; cover closely and place in a warm and even temperature.</variation> A good plan is to fold a clean blanket several times, and cover with it, providing the sponge is set in a very large <implement>crock</implement> or jar, so that there is no danger of its running over. As a general rule, one small tea-cup of yeast and three pints of "wetting" will make sponge enough for four ordinary loaves. In all sponges add the yeast last, making sure that it will not be scalded; when placed to rise, always cover closely. Many think it an improvement to beat the sponge thoroughly, like batter for a cake. All the various sponges are very nice baked on a griddle for breakfast-cakes, or, better still, in <implement>muffin-rings.</implement> When used in this way, add a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and make the sponge rather thick.</p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO MAKE GOOD BREAD.</purpose>



Always be</p>



<p align="center" size="smaller">"Up in the morning early, just at the peep of day,"</p>



<p>in summer time to prevent the sponge becoming sour by too long standing, and in winter to be getting materials warmed and in readiness for use. A large, seamless tin <implement>dish-pan</implement> with handles and<pb n="9" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=16"/>a tight-fitting cover, kept for this purpose alone, is better than a wooden bowl for bread. It should be thoroughly washed and scalded every time it is used. Measure and sift the <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> It is convenient to keep two quart cups, one for dry and the other for liquid measuring. In winter, always warm the flour and also the sponge. Put the flour in a bread-pan, make a large well in the center, into which pour the sponge, adding two level tea-spoons of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> (this is the quantity for four loaves of bread); mix well, being careful not to get the dough too stiff; turn out on the <implement>bread-board,</implement> rub the pan clean, and add the "rubbings" to the bread. Knead for fully twenty minutes, or until the dough ceases to stick to either the board or hands. The process of kneading is very important. Some good bread-makers knead with the palm of the hands until the dough is a flat cake, then fold once, repeating this operation until the dough is perfectly smooth and elastic; <variation>others close the hands and press hard and quickly into the dough with the fists, dipping them into the flour when the dough sticks, or, after kneading, chop with the <implement>chopping-knife</implement> and then knead again;</variation> <variation>others still knead with a <implement>potato-masher,</implement> thinking it a great saving of strength.</variation> No exact directions can be given, but experience and practice will prove the best guides. After the bread is thoroughly kneaded, form into a round mass or large loaf, sprinkle the bread-pan well with flour, and, having placed the loaf in it, sprinkle flour lightly on the top; cover, and set to rise in a warm temperature; let it rise well this time, say from one to two hours, owing to the season of the year. Place again on the <implement>bread-board,</implement> knead lightly with elastic movements for five minutes, again form into one large loaf, return to pan, and let rise, but not so long this time. Then knead down in the pan, cut into equal parts, place one at a time on the board, mold each into a smooth, oblong loaf, not too large, and put one after another into a well-greased <implement>baking-pan,</implement> and set to rise. Loaves made in the French style, long and narrow, are about half crust, and more easily digested, the action of heat anticipating part of the digestive process. In molding, do not leave any lumps or loose flour adhering to the outside, but mold until the loaves are perfectly smooth. No particular directions can be given in regard to the time bread should stand after it is molded and<pb n="10" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=17"/>placed in the pans, because here is the point where observation and discretion, are so indispensable. In hot weather, when the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> is very good and the bread very light, it must not stand over fifteen minutes before placing to bake. If it is cold weather and the yeast is less active, or the bread not perfectly raised, it may sometimes stand an hour in the pans without injury. When it is risen so as to seam or crack, it is ready for the oven; if it stands after this it becomes sour, and even if it does not sour it loses its freshness and sweetness, and the bread becomes dry sooner after baking. Bread should undergo but two fermentations; the saccharine or sweet fermentation, and the vinous, when it smells something like foaming beer. The housewife who would have good, sweet bread, must never let it pass this change, because the third or acetous fermentation then takes place. This last can be remedied by adding <ingredient>soda</ingredient> in the proportion of one tea-spoon to each quart of <ingredient>wetting;</ingredient> or, which is the same thing, a tea-spoon to four quarts of flour; but the bread will be much less nutritious and healthful, and some of the best elements of the flour will be lost. Always add salt to all bread, biscuit, griddle cakes, etc., but <emph rend="italic">never</emph> salt sponge. A small quantity of <ingredient>white sugar</ingredient> is an improvement to all bread dough. Bread should always be mixed as <emph rend="italic">soft as it can be handled</emph>.</p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">BREAD SPONGE AND BREAD.</purpose>



Five pints of <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> five quarts of <ingredient>sifted flour,</ingredient> one coffee-cup of <ingredient>yeast;</ingredient> mix in a two-gallon stone jar, cover closely, and set in a large tin pan, so that if the sponge rises over the top of the jar, the drippings may fall into the pan. Set to rise the evening before baking. In winter be careful to set in a warm place. In the morning sift six quarts of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into a pail, pour the sponge into the bread-pan or bowl, add two table-spoons of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> then the flour gradually; mix and knead well, using up nearly all the flour. This first kneading is the most important, and should occupy at least twenty minutes. Make the bread in one large loaf, set away in a warm place, and cover with a cloth. It ought to rise in half and hour; when it should be kneaded thoroughly again for ten minutes. Then take enough dough for three good-sized loaves (a quart bowl of dough to each), give five minutes kneading to each loaf, and place to rise in a <implement>dripping-pan</implement> well greased with <ingredient>lard.</ingredient> The loaves will be light in five or ten minutes; and will bake in a properly heated oven in half an hour. Make a well in the center or the remaining dough and into it put one-half tea-cup of <ingredient>white sugar,</ingredient> one tea-cup of lard, and two <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> which mix thoroughly with the dough, knead into one large loaf, set in a warm place about fifteen minutes to rise, and, when light, knead five minutes and let rise again for<pb n="13" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=20"/>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">BREAD WITH BUTTERMILK.</purpose>



The evening before baking, bring to the boiling point two quarts of <ingredient>buttermilk,</ingredient> and pour into a <implement>crock</implement> in which a scant tea-cup of sifted <ingredient>flour</ingredient> has been placed. Let stand till sufficiently cool, then add half a cup of <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> and <ingredient>flour</ingredient> to make a thick batter; the better and longer the sponge is stirred the whiter will be the bread. In the morning sift the flour into the bread-pan, pour the sponge in the center, stir in some of the flour, and let stand until after breakfast; then mix, kneading for about half an hour, the longer the better; when light, mold into loaves, this time kneading as little as possible. The secret of good bread is having good yeast, and not baking too hard. This makes four loaves and forty biscuit. <contributor rend="italic">--M. C. M.</contributor></p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">BREAD WITH POTATO SPONGE.</purpose>



Pare and boil four or five <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> mash fine, and add one pint of <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> pour on the mixture first <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> enough to moisten well, then about one quart of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> after which add flour enough to make a stiff batter.

The more kneading the finer and whiter the bread will be; pounding also with a <implement>potato-masher</implement> improves the bread greatly, and is rather easier than so much kneading. When quite stiff and well worked and pounded, let it rise again, and when light, make into loaves or biscuit, adding no more flour except to flour the hands and board--merely enough to prevent the bread from sticking. Let it rise again, then bake; and immediately after taking from the oven, wrap in a wet towel until partly cold, in order to soften the crust.

One tea-cup <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> three pints <ingredient>warm water;</ingredient> make a thin sponge at tea-time, cover and let it remain two hours or until very light.

Knead into a loaf before going to bed; in the morning mold into three loaves, spreading a little <ingredient>lard</ingredient> between as they are put in the pan. When light, bake one hour, having oven quite hot when the bread is put in, and very moderate when it is done.

take a part of the <ingredient>dough left from bread-making</ingredient> when it is ready to mold into loaves, work in the <ingredient>lard</ingredient> and any other ingredients desired, such as <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> <ingredient>spice,</ingredient> etc., also using a little more <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> let rise once, then mix down and let rise again; turn out on the <implement>bread-board;</implement> knead a few minutes, roll, and cut out with a <implement>biscuit-cutter</implement> or mold with the hand. Place in a well-greased <implement>dripping-pan,</implement> and when light bake in a quick oven from fifteen to twenty minutes. To make them a nice color, wet the top with <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> just before placing in the oven.

glaze, brush lightly with <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> or the well-beaten <ingredient>yolk of an egg</ingredient> sweetened, and a little <ingredient>milk</ingredient> added.</p>



<p>Biscuit may be baked in eight minutes by making the oven as hot as can be without burning, and allowing it to cool off gradually as they bake; this makes them very light, but one has to watch closely to keep them from being scorched. Any kind of bread or pastry mixed with water requires a hotter fire than that mixed with milk.</p>



<p>Biscuit for tea at six must be molded two hours before, which will give ample time for rising and baking. Parker House rolls for breakfast at eight must be made ready at five. Many think it unnecessary to knead down either bread or biscuit as often as here directed; but if attention is given to the dough at the right time, and it is not suffered to become <emph rend="italic">too light</emph>, it will be much nicer, whiter and of a finer texture if these directions are followed.</p></recipe>

<purpose>Soda biscuit</purpose>



must be handled as little and made as rapidly as possible; mix <ingredient>soda</ingredient> and <ingredient>cream tartar or baking-powder</ingredient> in the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> <variation>(with <ingredient>sweet milk</ingredient> use <ingredient>baking-powder or soda</ingredient> and <ingredient>cream tartar,</ingredient> with <ingredient>sour milk soda</ingredient> alone,)</variation> so that the effervescence takes place in the mixture. One tea-spoon soda and two of cream tartar, or three tea-spoons baking-powder, to every three pints of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> is about the right proportion. Bake in a quick oven as soon as made, and they rise more quickly if put into hot pans. Gems of all kinds require a hot oven, but the fire should be built sometimes before they are put into the oven and allowed to go down by the time they are light, as the heat necessary to raise them will burn them in baking if kept up:</p>



<p>Soda and raised biscuit and bread or cake, when stale, can be made almost as nice as fresh by plunging for an instant into <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and then placing in a pan in the oven ten or fifteen minutes; thus treated they should be used immediately.</p></recipe>

Although toast is commonly used, few know how to prepare it nicely. Take <ingredient>bread</ingredient> not too fresh, cut thin and evenly, trim off the crust-edges for the crumb-jar; first warm each side of the bread, then present the first side again to the fire until it takes on a rich, even, brown color; treat the other side in the same way; <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and serve immediately. The coals should be bright and hot. Toast properly made is very digestible; because all the moisture is extracted, and the bread has become pure farina of wheat, but when it is exposed to a hot fire and the outside charred, the inside remains as moist as ever. Butter applied to it while warm does not penetrate, but floats on the surface in the form of rancid oil.

<p>There are various ways of making, but the three best kinds are dry, soft hop, and potato yeast. The dry should be made in May or June for summer use, and in October for winter use. In hot and damp weather, dry yeast sometimes loses its vitality; however, many use it on account of its convenience, since there is no danger of its souring in summer or freezing in winter. Soft hop or potato yeast will keep in a cool place one or two weeks in warm weather, and in cold weather five or six weeks, care being taken that it does not freeze. Never add soda to yeast; if it becomes sour it will do to start fresh yeast, but will <emph rend="italic">never</emph> make good bread.

<p>"LET all things be done decently and in order," and the first to put in order when you are going to bake is yourself. Secure the hair in a net or other covering, to prevent any from falling, and brush the shoulders and back to be sure none are lodged there that might blow off; make the hands and finger-nails clean, roll the sleeves up above the elbows, and put on a large, clean apron. Clean the kitchen table of utensils and every thing not needed, and provide every thing that will be needed until the cake is baked, not forgetting even the broom-splints previously picked off the new broom and laid away carefully in a little box. (A knitting-needle may be kept for testing cake instead of splints.) If it is warm weather place the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and let stand a few minutes, as they will then make a finer froth, and be sure they are fresh, as they will not make a stiff froth with any amount of beating if old. Grease the pans with fresh <ingredient>lard,</ingredient> which is much better than butter; line the bottom with paper, using six or eight thicknesses if the 



<purpose>cake</purpose>



is large, and greasing the top one well. (In some ovens, however, fewer thicknesses of paper would be needed on the bottom, and in some the sides also should be lined with one or two thicknesses.) Sift <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> (if not pulverized) and measure or weigh. <ingredient>Firkin or very salt butter</ingredient> should be cut in bits and washed to freshen a little; if very hard, warm carefully, but in no case allow any of it to melt. Good butter must be used, as the heat develops any latent bad qualities. Beat the <ingredient>yolks of eggs</ingredient> thoroughly, and strain; set the <ingredient>whites</ingredient> away in a cool place until the cake is ready for them, then beat them vigorously in a cool room, till they will<pb n="42" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=49"/>



remain in the dish when turned upside down. Sift a part of the measured <ingredient>flour</ingredient> with the <ingredient>baking-powder or soda</ingredient> and <ingredient>cream tartar</ingredient> through a hand-sieve (which should be among the utensils of every housekeeper), and mix thoroughly with the rest of the flour. <variation>In using new flour for either breador cake-making, it can be "ripened" for use by placing the quantity intended for baking in the hot sun for a few hours, or before the kitchen fire.</variation> <variation>In using <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> note this: that <ingredient>sour milk</ingredient> makes a spongy, light cake; <ingredient>sweet milk,</ingredient> one that cuts like pound cake; remembering that with <ingredient>sour milk soda</ingredient> alone is used, while with sweet milk <ingredient>baking-powder or soda</ingredient> and <ingredient>cream tartar</ingredient> are to be added.</variation></p>



<p>Having thus gathered the material, beat the butter to a cream, add the sugar gradually, then the milk in small quantities (never use fresh and stale milk in same cake), next the <ingredient>yolks of eggs,</ingredient> then a part of the flour, then a part of the <ingredient>whites,</ingredient> and so on until the whole is used; lastly, add the <ingredient>flavoring.</ingredient> There is great "knack" in beating cake; don't <emph rend="italic">stir</emph>, but <emph rend="italic">beat</emph> thoroughly, bringing the batter up from the bottom of the dish at every stroke; in this way the air is driven into the cells of the batter, instead of out of them--but the cells will be finer if beaten more slowly at the last, remembering that the motion should always be upward. In winter it is easier to beat with the hand, but in summer a wooden spoon is better. Never beat a cake in tin, but use earthen or stoneware. All cakes not made with yeast should be baked as soon as possible after they are mixed. Unskillful mixing, too rapid or unequal baking, or a sudden decrease in heat before it is quite done, will cause streaks in the cake.</p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">FRUIT CAKE.</purpose>



Most ladies think fruit cake quite incomplete without wine or brandy, but it can be made equally good on strictly temperance principles, by substituting one-third of a cup of <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> for a wine-glass of brandy. <variation>To facilitate the operation of seeding <ingredient>raisins,</ingredient> pour <ingredient>boiling-water</ingredient> on a few at a time. This will not injure the fruit or cake. To seed, clip with the scissors, or cut with a sharp knife. Do not chop too fine; if for light fruit cake, seeding is all that is necessary.</variation> Slice the <ingredient>citron</ingredient> thin, and do not have the pieces too large, or they will cause the cake to break apart in cutting.<pb n="43" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=50"/>



<variation><ingredient>Currants</ingredient> should be kept prepared for use as follows: Wash in <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> rubbing well, pour off water, and repeat until the water is clear; drain them in a sieve, spread on a cloth and rub dry; pick out bad ones, dry carefully in a cool oven, and set away for use.</variation> When the fruit is all mixed, cream the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient>--this is very important in all cakes--add the <ingredient>spices,</ingredient> <ingredient>molasses,</ingredient> or <ingredient>liquors,</ingredient> then the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> (if any is used), next the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> well beaten, adding <ingredient>whites</ingredient> with the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> as previously directed. Always beat whites and <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> separately if many <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> are used, but if only a few, it is just as well to beat both together. Next add the flour (which in making black fruit cake may be browned), prepared with <ingredient>baking-powder or soda</ingredient> and <ingredient>cream tartar,</ingredient> then the <ingredient>flavoring</ingredient> (if any is used), and lastly the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> dredged with a <emph rend="italic">very little</emph> flour. <variation>Some prefer to <emph rend="italic">mix</emph> the fruit with all the flour.</variation></p>



<p><variation>In making very large cakes that require three or four hours to bake, an excellent way for 



<purpose>lining the pan</purpose>



is the following: Fit three papers carefully, grease thoroughly, make a paste of equal parts <ingredient>Graham</ingredient> and <ingredient>fine flour</ingredient> wet with <ingredient>water</ingredient> just stiff enough to spread easily with a spoon, place the first paper in the pan with the greased side down, and spread the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> evenly over the paper about as thick as pie-crust. In covering the sides of the pan, use a little paste to stick a portion of the <ingredient>paper</ingredient> to the top of the pan to keep it from slipping out of place, press the second paper carefully into its place with the greased side up, and next put in the third paper as you would into any <implement>baking-pan,</implement> and pour in the cake. Earthen pans are used by some, as they do not heat so quickly, and are less liable to burn the cake.</variation></p>



<p><variation>All except layer 



<purpose>cakes should be covered with a paper cap</purpose>



when first put into the oven. Take a square of <ingredient>brown paper</ingredient> large enough to cover well the cake-pan, cut off the corners, and lay a plait on four sides, fastening each with a pin so as to fit nicely over the pan. This will throw it up in the center, so that the cover will not touch the cake. Save the cap, as it can be used several times.</variation></p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">SPONGE-CAKE.</purpose>



The good quality of all delicate cake, and especially of sponge-cake, depends very much upon its being made with fresh <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> It must be quickly put together, beaten with rapidity, and baked in a rather quick oven. It is made "sticky" and less light by being stirred long. There is no other cake so dependent upon care and good judgement in baking as sponge-cake. <variation><purpose>In making white cake,</purpose> if not convenient to use the <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> that are left, they will keep until the next day by being <emph rend="italic">thoroughly</emph> beaten and set in a cool place.</variation> <variation><purpose>To prepare cocoa-nut,</purpose>cut a hole through the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> at one of the holes in the end, draw off the <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> pound the nut well on all sides to loosen the meat, crack, take out meat, and set the pieces in the <implement>heater</implement> or in a cool, open oven over night, or for a few hours, to dry, then grate; if all is not used, sprinkle with <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> (after grating) and spread out in a cool, dry place, and it will keep for weeks.</variation> In cutting layer cakes, it is better to first make a round hole in the center, with a knife, or a tin tube, about an inch and a quarter in diameter. This prevents the edge of the cake from crumbling in cutting.</p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">ROLLED JELLY CAKE.</purpose>



Beat twelve <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> and one pound <ingredient>pulverized sugar</ingredient> together very lightly, then stir in three-fourths pound of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> making batter as light as for sponge-cake, and thin enough to spread nicely when poured; make up as quickly as possible. Have shallow tin-pans prepared (about twelve by eighteen inches and an inch deep) by lining with thin brown paper, using no grease on pan or paper; pour in batter, spread out with a knife as thin as possible (about half an inch thick), and bake in solid oven. When done, remove from oven, let cool a few minutes, and while still warm, but not hot, turn out of pan upside down. With a brush or soft cloth wet in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> brush over the paper and pull it off; spread cake thin with <ingredient>jelly</ingredient> and roll it up, being careful to place the outer edge of roll against something so that it will not unroll until cold. Sprinkle with <ingredient>powdered sugar</ingredient> and serve. If baked in pans such as are described above, the recipe will make two rolls, each twelve inches long, which should be cut in two, making four rolls. Use no baking-powder, as it makes the cake too brittle. Many use none in sponge-cake. The paper lining should be larger than pan, to lift out the cake by taking hold of the projecting edges.<contributor rend="italic">--C. W. Cyphers, Minneapolis.</contributor></p></recipe>

<purpose>For creams and custards</purpose> eggs should never be beaten in tin, but always in stone or earthen ware, as there is some chemical influence about tin which prevents their attaining that creamy lightness so desirable. Beat quickly and sharply right through the eggs, beating whites and yolks separately. <variation>When <ingredient>gelatine</ingredient> is used for creams, it is better to soak it for an hour in a little <ingredient>cold water or milk,</ingredient> set in a warm place; when dissolved, pour into the hot custard just after removing from the stove.</variation> <variation><purpose>For custards</purpose> the common rule is four <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> one cup <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and one small half tea-spoon <ingredient>salt</ingredient> to each quart of <ingredient>milk.</ingredient> Bake in a baking-dish until firm in the center, taking care that the heat is moderate or the custard will turn in part to whey. The delicacy of the custard depends on its being baked <emph rend="italic">slowly.</emph> It is much nicer to strain the yolks, after they are beaten, through a small wire strainer kept for this purpose by every good housekeeper.</variation> <variation><purpose>For boiled custards or floats</purpose> the <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> alone may be used, or for economy's sake the entire eggs. Always place the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> to boil in a custard-kettle (made of iron with another iron kettle inside, the latter lined with tin), or, in a pan or pail set within a kettle of <ingredient><emph rend="italic">boiling</emph> water;</ingredient> when the milk reaches the boiling point, which is shown by a slight foam rising on top, add the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> which cools it so that the eggs will not curdle when added.</variation> <variation>Or, another convenient way is to mix the beaten and strained yolks with the sugar in a bowl, then add gradually several spoonfuls of the <ingredient>boiling milk,</ingredient> until the eggs and sugar are heated through, when they may be slowly stirred into the boiling milk. Let remain a few moments, stirring constantly until it thickens a little, but not long enough to curdle, then either set the pail immediately<pb n="84" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=91"/>in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> or turn out into a cold dish, adding flavoring extracts after removing from the stove. <ingredient>Peach leaves or vanilla beans</ingredient> give a fine flavor, but must be boiled in the milk and then taken out before the other ingredients are added.

<purpose>Roast coffee</purpose>



with the greatest care--for here lies the secret of success in coffee-making--and in small quantities, for there is a peculiar freshness of flavor when newly roasted. Pick over carefully, wash and dry in a moderate oven, increase the heat and roast quickly, either in the oven, or on top of the stove or range; in the latter case, stir <emph rend="italic">constantly,</emph> and in the oven stir <emph rend="italic">often,</emph> with a wooden spoon or ladle kept for this purpose. The <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> must be thoroughly and evenly roasted to a dark rich brown, not black, throughout, and must be free from any burnt grains, a few of which will ruin the flavor of a large quantity. It must be tender and brittle, to test which take a grain, place it on the table, press with the thumb and if it can be crushed, it is done. Stir in a lump of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> while the coffee is hot, or wait until about half cold and then stir in a well-beaten <ingredient>egg.</ingredient> The latter plan is very economical, as coffee so prepared needs no further clarifying. Keep in a closely-covered tin or earthen vessel. Never attempt other work while roasting coffee, but give it the entire attention. Do not grind too fine, and only in quantities as needed, for the flavor is dissipated if it is long unused after grinding, even when under cover. If properly roasted, coffee will grind into distinct, hard, and gritty particles and not into a powder.</p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">MAKING COFFEE.</purpose>



"One for the pot" and a heaping table-spoon of <ingredient>ground coffee</ingredient> for each person, is the usual allowance. Mix well, either with a part or the whole of an <ingredient>egg</ingredient> and enough <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> to thoroughly moisten it, place in a well-scalded <implement>coffee-boiler,</implement> pour in half the quantity of <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> needed, allowing one pint less of water than there are table-spoons of coffee. Roll a cloth tightly and stop up the nose or spout, thus keeping in all the coffee flavor. Boil rather fast five minutes, stirring down from the top and sides as it boils up, and place on back part of stove or range where it will only simmer for ten or fifteen minutes longer. When ready to serve add the remainder of the boiling water. Coffee boiled a long time is strong, but not so well flavored or agreeable as when prepared as above.</p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">FILTERED COFFEE.</purpose>



The National <implement>Coffee-pot</implement> is so widely known as not to need description here, but the "gude wife" can improvise one equally as desirable and much simpler. Make a sack of fine flannel, or canton flannel, as long as the <implement>coffee-pot</implement> is deep, and a little larger than the top; stitch up the side seam to within an inch and a half of the top, bend a piece of small but rather stiff wire in a circle, and slip it through a hem made around the top of the sack, bringing the ends together at the opening left and the top of the side seam. Having put the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> in the sack, lower it into the <implement>coffee-pot</implement> with the ends of the wire next to the handle, spread the ends of the wire apart slightly, and push it down over the top of the pot. The top of the sack will then be turned down a little over the outside of the pot, a part of it covering the "nose," and keeping in all the aroma, the elasticity of the wire causing it to close tight around the pot, holding the sack close to its sides. Instead of a wire (which must be removed to wash the sack after using), a tape may be used by tying the ends after turning the top of sack down. When the sack, with the coffee in it is in its place, pour the <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> over the coffee, close the lid tightly, and let simmer (not boil) fifteen minutes to half an hour. In pouring for the table raise the sack off the nose but not out of pot. This makes good coffee without eggs or any thing else to settle it.</p></recipe>

<p>Perfectly fresh sweet cream makes the most delicious ice-cream. A substitute is a preparation of boiled milk, etc., made late in the evening if for dinner, in the morning if for tea, and placed on ice. One mixture is a 



<purpose>custard</purpose>



made as follows: Take two quarts <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> put on three pints to boil in a <implement>custard-kettle,</implement> or a pail set within a kettle of <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> beat <ingredient>yolks and whites of eight eggs</ingredient> separately, mix the <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> with the remaining pint and stir <emph rend="italic">slowly</emph> into the boiling milk, boil two minutes, remove from the stove, <emph rend="italic">immediately</emph> add one and a half pounds <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> let it dissolve, strain while <emph rend="italic">hot</emph> through a <implement>crash towel,</implement> cool, add one quart <ingredient>rich cream</ingredient> and two table-spoons <ingredient>vanilla,</ingredient> (or season to taste, remembering that the strength of the flavoring and also the sweetness is very much diminished by the freezing). Set the custard and also the <ingredient>whites</ingredient> (not beaten) in a cool place until needed, and about three hours before serving begin the preparations for freezing. Put the <ingredient>ice</ingredient> in a coarse coffee-sack, pound with an ax or mallet until the lumps are no larger than a small hickory-nut; see that the freezer is properly set in the tub, the beater in and the cover secure; place around it a layer of ice about three inches thick, then a layer of <ingredient>coarse salt</ingredient>--<ingredient>rock salt</ingredient> is best--then ice again, then salt, and so on until packed full, with a layer of ice last. The proportion should be about three-fourths ice and one-fourth salt. Pack very solid, pounding with a broom-handle or stick, then remove the cover and pour the custard to which you have just added the well-whipped whites into the freezer, filling two-thirds full to give room for expansion; replace the cover and begin turning the freezer; after ten minutes pack the ice down again, drain off most of the water, add more ice and turn again, repeating<pb n="148" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=155"/>



this operation several times until the cream is well frozen, and you can no longer turn the beater. (The above quantity ought to freeze in half an hour, but the more pure cream used the longer it takes to freeze). Brush the ice and salt from and remove the cover, take out the beater, scrape the cream down from the sides of freezer, beat well several minutes with a wooden paddle, replace the cover, fill the hole with a cork, pour off all the water, pack again with ice, (using salt at the bottom, but none at the top of tub), heap the ice on the cover, spread over it a piece of carpet or a thick woollen blanket, and set away in a cool place until needed; or, if molds are used, fill them when you remove the beater, packing the cream in very tightly, and place in ice and salt for two hours. To remove the cream, dip the molds for an instant in <ingredient>warm water.</ingredient> When cream is used in making ice-cream, it is better to whip a part of it, and add just as the cream is beginning to set.</p></recipe>

<p>The following directions for 



<purpose>making "self-freezing ice-cream"</purpose>



are from <attribution>"Common Sense in the Household."</attribution> After preparing the freezer as above, but leaving out the beater, remove the lid carefully, and with a long wooden ladle or flat stick beat the <ingredient>custard</ingredient> as you would batter steadily for five or six minutes. Replace the lid, pack the <ingredient>ice</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> over it, covering it with about two inches of the mixture; spread above all several folds of blanket or carpet, and leave it untouched for an hour; at the end of that time remove the ice from above the freezer-lid, wipe off carefully and open the freezer. Its sides will be lined with a thick layer of frozen cream. Displace this with the ladle or a long knife, working every part of it loose; beat up the custard again firmly and vigorously, until it is all smooth, half-congealed paste. The perfection of the ice-cream depends upon the thoroughness of the beating at this point. Put on the cover again, pack in more ice and salt, turn off the brine, cover the freezer entirely with the ice, and spread over all, the carpet. At the end of two or three hours more, again turn off the brine and add fresh ice and salt, but do not open the freezer for two hours more. At that time take the freezer from the ice, open it, wrap a towel wet in <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> about the lower part, and turn out a solid column of ice-cream, close grained, firm, delicious.

<p>Inattention to the temperature of the water and too early application of salt cause great waste in 



<purpose>boiling meats.</purpose>



To make fresh <ingredient>meat</ingredient> rich and nutritious it should be placed in a kettle of <ingredient><emph rend="italic">boiling</emph> water</ingredient> (pure soft water is best), skimmed well as soon as it begins to boil again, and placed where it will slowly but constantly simmer. The meat should be occasionally turned and kept well under the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and fresh <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> supplied as it evaporates in boiling. The hot water hardens the fibrine on the outside, encasing and retaining the rich juices--and the whole theory of correct cooking in a nut-shell, is to retain as much as possible of the nutriment of food. No salt should be added until the meat is nearly done, as it extracts the juices of the meat if added too soon. Boil gently, as rapid boiling hardens the fibrine and renders the meat hard, tasteless, and scarcely more nutritious than leather, without really hastening the process of cooking, every degree of heat beyond the boiling point being worse than wasted. <variation><purpose>Salt meat</purpose> should be put on in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> so that it may freshen in cooking. Allow twenty minutes to the pound for fresh, and thirty-five for salt meats, the time to be modified, of course, by the quality of the meat.</variation> <variation>A pod of <ingredient>red pepper</ingredient> in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> will prevent the unpleasant odor of boiling from filling the house.</variation></p></recipe>

<purpose>Broiling</purpose>



is a far more wholesome method of cooking <ingredient>meats</ingredient> than frying. Tough <ingredient>steak</ingredient> is made more tender by pounding or hacking with a dull knife, but some of the juices are lost by the operation; cutting it across in small squares with a <emph rend="italic">sharp</emph> knife on both sides is better than either.

A small pair of tongs are best to turn steaks, as piercing with a fork frees the juices. If fat drips on the coals below, the blaze may be extinguished by sprinkling with salt, always withdrawing the <implement>gridiron</implement> to prevent the steak from acquiring a smoky flavor. Always have a brisk fire, whether you cook in a <implement>patent broiler</implement> directly over the fire, or on a <implement>gridiron</implement> over a bed of live coals.

The next day drain off and boil syrup a few minutes only, and pour back, repeating daily until the fruit looks clear. Two or three times is generally sufficient. The last time put up the preserves in small jars, and secure with paper as directed for jellies. If to be sealed in cans, the first boiling is sufficient, after which put into cans and seal immediately. The latter plan is preferable, as it takes less trouble and less sugar, while the natural flavor of the fruit is better retained.</p></recipe>

<purpose>shell-fish,</purpose> and are an important article of food from September to May. In most localities they are not more expensive than meats, and the great variety of ways in which they can be cooked, makes them a favorite with house-keepers. Oysters in the shell must be kept in a cool cellar and occasionally sprinkled with salt water. When fresh the shell is firmly closed; if opened the oyster is dead and unfit for use. The small-shelled oysters have the finest flavor.

with flavors properly commingled, is an art which requires study and practice, but it is surprising from what a scant allotment of material a delicate and appetizing dish may be produced.

To four pounds of <ingredient>lean beef</ingredient> (the inferior parts are quite as good for this purpose), put five quarts of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> (soft is best), wash the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and put it in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> without salt; let it come slowly to boiling point, and then skim well, set it back and let it simmer gently for six or eight hours until the meat is in rags; rapid boiling hardens the fiber of the meat and the savory flavor escapes with the steam; add a little <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> strain into a stone jar, let it cool, and remove all the grease. This stock will keep for many days in cold weather, and from it can be made all the various kinds of soups by adding <ingredient>onion,</ingredient> <ingredient>macaroni,</ingredient> <ingredient>celery,</ingredient> <ingredient>asparagus,</ingredient> <ingredient>green pease,</ingredient> <ingredient>carrot,</ingredient> <ingredient>tomato,</ingredient> <ingredient>okra,</ingredient> <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> <ingredient>thyme,</ingredient> <ingredient>summer savory,</ingredient> <ingredient>sage,</ingredient> and slices of <ingredient>lemon;</ingredient> many of these may be first dried, then pulverized and put in cans or jars for winter use. <variation><ingredient>Celery</ingredient> and <ingredient>carrot seed</ingredient> may be used in place of the fresh vegetables.</variation> <variation>Macaroni should be first boiled in slightly <ingredient>salted water,</ingredient> cut in pieces one or two inches long, and added a short time before serving.</variation> <variation>To prepare soup for dinner, cut off a slice of the <ingredient>jelly,</ingredient> add <ingredient>water,</ingredient> heat and serve.</variation> <variation>Whatever is added to this, such as <ingredient>rice,</ingredient> <ingredient>tapioca,</ingredient> <ingredient>vegetables,</ingredient> etc., may first be cooked before being added, as much boiling injures the flavor of the stock.</variation> <variation>A rich stock can also be made from a <ingredient>shank or shin of beef</ingredient> <ingredient>(knuckle of veal</ingredient> is next best).

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">DRYING CORN.</purpose>



Select good <ingredient>ears of sweet corn,</ingredient> husk, take off silk carefully, but do not wash; shave with a sharp knife, not too close to the cob, into a large tin pan or wooden bowl, scrape cob to get all the milk of corn; when about three quarts are cut off, line a large <implement>dripping-pan</implement> with flour-sack paper, being careful to have sides and edges covered, pour in <ingredient>corn,</ingredient> spread, and put at once in moderate oven; stir frequently and leave in oven fifteen or twenty minutes. Set a table out in the sun, cover with a cloth, pour the corn upon it and spread out evenly and thinly. Before sunset bring the corn in and spread on a table in the house; in the morning heat again in oven and spread in sun as before. If directions are closely followed, the corn will be thoroughly dried on the evening of the second day, and when shaken will rattle; store in paper bag as soon as cooled. Prepare in small quantities, because it must not stand long after being shaven, but should at once go into oven to heat. When all is dried, put in oven for final heating; place to cool, pour into the bag, tie closely, and hang in a cool, dry, dark place.</p></recipe>

This old-fashioned luxury is really a delicious dish when properly prepared.

Turn off the lye and strain; put it into an iron kettle, and put in six quarts of <ingredient>shelled corn;</ingredient> put it over a brisk fire, and let it boil half an hour, skimming and stirring frequently, (the outside skin of the kernels will then slip off); strain off the lye, and rinse thoroughly in several clear waters. When the lye is thus weakened turn the corn into a large <implement>dish-pan,</implement> and turn in <ingredient>water</ingredient> enough to cover it; then rub thoroughly with the hands, till the black chits come off; rinse and strain off till the water looks clear; then put back into a clean kettle, with water enough to cover it, and let it boil, then turn off water, put on again and parboil three or four times (it will swell to about double the first quantity); the last time boil till quite soft; it may be necessary to add water occasionally; stir often,<pb n="283" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=290"/>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">POTATOES IN KENTUCKY STYLE.</purpose>



The <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> are sliced thin, as for frying, and allowed to remain in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> half an hour. The slices are then put into a <implement>pudding dish,</implement> with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> and some <ingredient>milk</ingredient>--about half a pint to an ordinary <implement>pudding-dish.</implement> They are then put into an oven and baked for an hour. When taken out, a lump of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> half the size of a hen's egg is cut into small bits and scattered over the top. Those who have never eaten potatoes cooked thus do not know all the capabilities of that esculent tuber. The slicing allows the interior of each potato to be examined, hence its value where potatoes are doubtful, though poor ones are not of necessity required. The soaking in cold water hardens the slices, so that they will hold their shape. The milk serves to cook them through, and to make a nice brown on the top; the quantity can only be learned by experience; if just a little is left as a rich gravy, moistening all the slices, then it is right. In a year of small and poor potatoes, this method of serving them will be very welcome to many a housekeeper.<contributor rend="italic">--Mrs. C. M. Nichols.

<p>Mutton should be fat, and the fat clear and white. Be wary of buying mutton with yellow fat. An abundance of fat is a source of waste, but as the lean part of fat mutton is much more juicy and tender than any other, it should be chosen. After the butcher has cut off all he can be persuaded to remove, you will still have to trim it freely before broiling. The lean of mutton> is quite different from that of beef. While beef is a bright carnation, mutton is a deep, dark red. The hind quarter of mutton is best for roasting. The ribs may be used for chops and are the sweeter, but the leg cutlets are the most economical, as there is much less bone, and no hard meat as on the ribs. <variation>Almost any part will do for

As much of the fat should be removed as practicable, then cut into small pieces and simmered slowly until the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> falls to pieces. Drain off and skim off any remaining fat, and thicken with <ingredient>rice or vermicelli.</ingredient></variation></p></recipe>

<p>No sloven can make good 



<purpose>butter.</purpose>



The <emph rend="italic">one thing</emph> to be kept in mind, morning, noon and night, is neatness, neatness, neatness. The milking should be done in the cleanest place that can be found, and the <ingredient>cows</ingredient> should be kept as clean as possible. Wash the teats and udders thoroughly with plenty of cold water, and wipe with a cloth or towel. Never wash with the hand moistened with milk from the cow. The least impurity taints the cream, and takes from the sweetness of the butter. Milk perfectly clean, (as the last quart is twice as rich in butter as the first,) and the quicker the milking is done the more milk is obtained. The milk-room should be clean and sweet, its air pure, and temperature about 62 degrees. As soon as a pail is filled, take to the milk-room and strain the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> through a fine <implement>wire-cloth strainer,</implement> kept for the purpose, and not attached to the pail (the simple strainer being more easily kept clean). Never allow milk to stand in the stable and cool, as it absorbs the foul odors of the place. The pans (flat <implement>stone crocks</implement> with flaring sides are better that tin pans. In winter <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> should be poured into them while milking is being done, and poured out just before straining the milk into them) should be set on slats, rather than shelves, as it is important to have the milk cooled from the animal heat as soon as possible. Skim each day, or at longest within twenty-four hours. Souring does not injure the quality of the cream, but the milk should not be allowed to become watery. Do not use a <implement>perforated skimmer,</implement> but remove a little of the milk with the <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> as this does not injure the quality or lessen the quantity of butter, and gives more well-flavored buttermilk, which is a favorite and wholesome drink. If there is cream enough each day, it should, of course, be churned, and this plan makes the best <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> although it takes longer to churn it. If not, the cream should be set aside in a cool place, covered, and stirred thoroughly whenever more is added. It ought not to stand more than two days, and must not be allowed to become bitter and flaky. The best plan is to churn as soon as it becomes slightly acid. Scald the <implement>churn</implement> and dash thoroughly, and put in the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> at a temperature of 58 degrees. The motion of the <implement>churn</implement> will soon bring it up to about 60 degrees. When the butter comes put a quart or two of <ingredient>cold, soft water</ingredient> (or ice is better) into the <implement>churn</implement> to harden the butter, and make it easier to gather up. After gathering it as well as possible with the dash, it should be removed to the table or bowl, and thoroughly worked with a flat wooden paddle, (never with the hand, as the insensible perspiration will more or less taint the butter,) using an abundance of cold <emph rend="italic">soft</emph> water to wash out the buttermilk and harden the butter. By this process the <ingredient>buttermilk</ingredient> is removed quickly, and there is no need of excessive working, which injures the grain of the butter. This is especially true of that which is to be packed, as it keeps longer when well washed. If to be used immediately, the washing may be less thorough. Another and better plan is to remove the butter to a marble slab and lay on the top of it a piece of <ingredient>ice.</ingredient> As it settles down by its own weight, work it up around the edges with the paddle, and the water from the melting ice will wash out and carry off the buttermilk. Before or during the churning, the bowl (which should never be used for any thing else) in which the butter is to be salted should be filled with <ingredient>scalding water,</ingredient> which should remain for ten minutes; pour out and rub both bowl and<pb n="384" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=379"/>



paddle with <ingredient>hard coarse salt,</ingredient> which prevents butter from sticking. Rinse thoroughly and fill with <ingredient>cold or ice-water</ingredient> to cool. After washing butter free from milk, remove to this bowl, having first poured out the <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and (the butter-bowl and paddle should occasionally be scoured with <ingredient>sand or ashes,</ingredient> washed thoroughly with <ingredient>soap-suds,</ingredient> and rinsed until all smell of soap has disappeared,) work in gradually salt which has been pulverized by rolling, and freed from foreign substances. If wanted for use, one-half ounce of salt> to the pound of butter is sufficient, but if wanted for packing, use three-fourths of an ounce or even an ounce of salt. Use only the best quality of <ingredient>dairy salt.</ingredient> After salting, cover with cotton cloth soaked in <ingredient>brine,</ingredient> and set away in a temperature of about 60 degrees for twelve hours. Work the second time just enough to get the remaining buttermilk out. This, however, must be done thoroughly, as otherwise the acid of the buttermilk will make the butter rancid. At the end of the second working it is ready for use, and should be kept in a clean, sweet place, as it soon absorbs bad odors and becomes tainted. The air of a cellar in which are decaying vegetables soon ruins the sweetest butter. <variation><purpose>In packing for market,</purpose> (ash butter-tubs are the neatest and best packages,) soak the package for twelve hours in brine strong enough to float an egg, pack the butter in evenly and firmly, having first put in a thin layer of salt. If the tub is not filled by the first packing, set away until next churning, in a cool place, with a cotton cloth wet in brine spread over the butter, and place cover carefully on the tub. When filled, lay over the butter a cotton cloth (from which the sizing has been washed) soaked in strong brine, nail up the tub, and set away in a clean, cool place until ready to sell.</variation></p>



<p><variation><purpose>In packing for family use,</purpose> work into rolls, lay in large <implement>stone crocks,</implement> cover with brine strong enough to float an egg, in which a level tea-spoon of <ingredient>saltpeter</ingredient> and a pound of <ingredient>white sugar</ingredient> to each two gallons have been added; over it place a cotton cloth and a weight to keep the butter under the brine, and tie a paper over the top of <implement>crock.</implement> Or pack in a stone jar, pressing it solid with a <implement>wooden pestle,</implement> cover with a cloth wet in brine, and sprinkle over it salt an inch thick.
