Meat that has been hanging up some time should be roasted in preference to boiling, as the fire extracts any taste it may have acquired.

<p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">To Make Cider.</purpose>







To make cider that will keep sweet for a length of time, requires particular attention to all the points. All the works and utensils in use must be perfectly clean, so that nothing acid shall come in contact with the pulp or liquor while pressing. The <implement>casks</implement> should be cleaned in the following manner:</p>



<p>After washing each barrel clean, put in a lump of unslacked lime, and pour in a gallon of boiling water; bung it up, and roll the barrel several times a day,



<pb n="154" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=158"/>



letting it lay with the bung down; in the evening, empty out the lime-water, and wash the barrel clean in several waters; after the water is drained out, burn a brimstone match in it, made of a piece of coarse muslin one inch broad, and four long, dipped in melted brimstone; light one end of the match, and put it in; put the bung on slightly, so as to hold the other end, and allow air sufficient to make it burn; when the rag has burned out, drive in the bung to keep in the sulphuric gas, which, if allowed time, will condense on the sides.</p>



<p>The <ingredient>apples</ingredient> should be kept under cover, and secured from rain. After they have laid to mellow for two or three weeks, select those that are sound; break off the stems and leaves; have the trough perfectly clean, and after they are ground, keep them from the sun and rain for twenty-four hours; then press them, and fill into the <implement>casks;</implement> the first running is always the best; each <implement>cask</implement> that is filled should be numbered, so as to know the quality; and after they are all filled, draw off and mix them, the weak with the strong; keep the <implement>casks</implement> filled up with <ingredient>cider</ingredient> while they are fermenting; when the fermentation is subsiding, there will be a thin white scum rise slowly: when this is all off, lay on the bung lightly; rack it off in a few days in barrels, in which brimstone has been used, and bung it tight; rack it off again in March, and keep the bungs in tight.</p>

<p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">To Make Vinegar.</purpose>







You may always have good <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> for pickling, and other purposes, by taking a little pains. Get a tight <implement>whiskey barrel,</implement> if it is clean you need not rinse it, and out into it ten gallons of the best <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> you can



<pb n="155" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=159"/>



procure, with one quart of <ingredient>whiskey</ingredient> and one quart of <ingredient>molasses;</ingredient> every day for a week, add a gallon of good <ingredient>cider</ingredient> that has not been watered, and shake the barrel each time; let it stand in this state two weeks, shaking the barrel frequently. After this, you may put in a gallon of <ingredient>cider</ingredient> occasionally, with any that has been left at table, or the <ingredient>settlings of decanters or bottles that have had wine in,</ingredient> but do not put in any water. It will make much sooner in the garret or a warm place, but if the barrel is fixed early in the summer, you will have plenty to pickle with in the fall; taste it so as not to add <ingredient>cider</ingredient> too fast. Have a <implement>phial</implement> with a string attached to it that you can put in at the bung. You should have a barrel of good hard <ingredient>cider</ingredient> before you begin to make <ingredient>vinegar.</ingredient> If you are in want of <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> fill a jug from the barrel, and set it in the hot sun, where it will turn sour much quicker. It is a good plan to keep a jug in a closet, where you can empty all the slops of <ingredient>cider</ingredient> and <ingredient>wine;</ingredient> and when you get it full, empty it in the barrel.</p>



<p>After the pickling is done, you can put as much <ingredient>hard cider</ingredient> in the barrel, a gallon at a time, as you have taken out, with a little <ingredient>molasses,</ingredient> and half a pint of <ingredient>whiskey;</ingredient> if you put too much of the latter it will prevent it from getting sour, but a little gives strength to the <ingredient>cider,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> increases the acidity, and helps to color it. If you should have any <ingredient>juice of cherries, currants, or blackberries,</ingredient> put it in, or if you can get cheap <ingredient>sour raisins,</ingredient> they will be an improvement to the flavor of the vinegar; a tea-cup of <ingredient>burnt sugar</ingredient> will give it a good color.</p>



<p>Vinegar made in this way will keep <ingredient>pickles</ingredient> good for several years. If the cider has not sufficient strength it will take longer to make.</p>

Have the rounds divided, leaving a piece of the sinew to hang up by; lay the pieces in a tub of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> for an hour; then rub each piece of <ingredient>beef</ingredient> that will weigh fifteen or twenty pounds, with a handful of <ingredient>brown sugar</ingredient> and a table-spoonful of <ingredient>saltpetre,</ingredient> pulverized, and a pint of <ingredient>fine salt;</ingredient> sprinkle <ingredient>fine salt</ingredient> in the bottom of a clean tight barrel, and lay the pieces in, strewing a little <ingredient>coarse salt</ingredient> between each piece; let it lay two days; then make the brine in a clean tub, with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and ground <ingredient>alum salt</ingredient>--stir it well; it must be strong enough to bear an egg half up; put in half a pound of best <ingredient>brown sugar</ingredient> and a table-spoonful of <ingredient>saltpetre</ingredient> to each gallon of the <ingredient>salt and water;</ingredient> pour it over the <ingredient>beef;</ingredient> put a clean large stone on the top of the meat to keep it under the pickle, (which is very important;) put a cover on the barrel; examine it occasionally to see that the pickle does not leak,--and if it should need more, add of the same strength; let it stand six weeks, when hang it up in the smoke-house, and after it has drained, smoke it moderately for ten days; it should then hang in a dry place; before cooking, let it soak for twenty-four hours: a piece that weighs fifteen or twenty pounds should boil two hours--one half the size, one hour, and a small piece should soak six or twelve

hours, according to size. <ingredient>Beef</ingredient> cured in this way will make a nice relish, when thinly sliced and eaten cold, for breakfast or tea, or put between slices of bread and butter for lunch; it will keep for several weeks,--and persons of delicate stomachs can sometimes relish a thin slice, eaten cold, when they cannot retain hot or rich food.</p>

<p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">Butter.</purpose>







IT is of the first importance that every thing connected with milk and butter should be kept clean; if the milk acquires an unpleasant taste, it communicates it to the butter. Tin pans are best to keep milk in, and they should be painted on the outside to keep them from rusting when they are put in water.</p>



<p>In summer, <ingredient>milk</ingredient> should be kept as cool as possible; before it is strained, the pans and strainer should be rinsed with cold water, and the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> not covered until it is cold; as soon as the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> rises sufficiently, it should be skimmed, and put in a large tin bucket with



<pb n="177" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=181"/>



a lid that fits down tight, and stirred every day. Butter will be spoiled by neglecting to stir the <ingredient>cream;</ingredient> a yellow scum will form on it, which gives it an unpleasant taste. And if you leave a pan of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> till the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is covered with spots of mould, you had better throw it away than put it in, as it will spoil the taste of a whole churning.</p>



<p>If you have no way of keeping your <ingredient>cream</ingredient> cool in hot weather, it ought to be churned twice a week; the earlier in the morning the better. Always put <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> in your churn the night before you use it, and change it in the morning just before you put in the <ingredient>cream.</ingredient> When the butter is gathering, take off the lid of the churn to let the heated air escape, and move it gently; have your <implement>butter-ladle</implement> and pan scalded and cooled; take out the butter and work it till all the milk is out; scrape some lumps of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and work in; cover it up, and set away in a cool place till the next morning, when work it again.</p>



<p>If you have neither an ice, or <implement>spring-house,</implement> a box by the side of the pump, with a cover over it, is very convenient to put cream and butter down the well; put them in tin kettles with covers to fit tight, and fasten them to strong tarred ropes twenty feet long. The air of a well will keep butter sweet for several weeks in the hottest weather. It is best to have one kettle or basket to put the butter in that is used at the table; it should be deep enough to hold five or six plates, each covered with a saucer. It can be kept in this way as firm and sweet as in an ice-house. You can have a separate kettle to put a large lump of butter in for seasoning vegetables. If you print butter for home use, it is not necessary to weigh it; make it out in little lumps that will weigh about half a pound; scald



<pb n="178" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=182"/>



the print and ladle, and put them in <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> as you print each lump, lay it on a dish.</p>



<p>In winter it is more difficult to have good butter, as much depends on the food of the cows; the milk should be kept in a cellar, where it will not freeze; if you have a safe to keep it in, it need not be covered. Cream takes much longer to rise in winter; after it has stood two days, to put it on the top of a moderately heated stove will assist it; when it is hot, set it away to skim the next day, when the cream will be thick and rich, and churns easier.</p>



<p>If the weather is very cold, and the cream has been chilled, have a large pot of water over the fire, set in the bucket when it is near boiling heat, and keep stirring till it is milk-warm; have the churn scalded and put it in; by churning steadily, it will come as quick as in summer; one good working answers very well for butter in winter; always scald the churn before you put in the cream in cold weather.</p>

Work it well, and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> it rather more than for table use, and pack it in stone pans or jars, with a thin cloth on the top, and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> on it an inch thick; keep it in a cool place, and if it is sweet when made, it will keep good till spring.

<pb n="179" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=183"/>



well together; keep this mixture covered up close in a nice jar, and placed in a dry closet.</p>



<p>When your <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is worked and salted in the usual way, and ready to put in the jars, use one ounce of this composition to every pound of <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> work it well into the mass.</p>



<p><ingredient>Butter</ingredient> cured in this way, (it is said) will keep good for several years. I have never kept it longer than from the fall until late in the spring, it was then very sweet and good.</p>



<p>It will not do to use for a month, because earlier, the salts will not be sufficiently blended with it. It should be kept in wooden vessels, or nice stone jars. Earthenware jars are not suitable for butter, as during the decomposition of the salts, they corrode the glazing; and the butter becomes rancid and unhealthy.</p>



<p>A friend of mine, and a lady of much experience, remarked on reading the above--"This is an admirable receipt, and by attention to its directions, butter may be packed away with success even in the summer months. Thus in cities during warm weather butter is often cheap, a house-keeper may then purchase her winter supply.</p>



<p>"Select that which is sweetest and most firm; begin by putting a layer of the prints in the bottom of a stone pot; press the butter down close, so that no cavities for the admission of air may remain, then strew more of the mixture over it; proceed in this manner until the vessel is filled, when put on the top a small muslin bag filled with salt, and tie the jar up close. It is very important to keep the butter in a cool place."</p>



<p>A great deal depends on the butter being well worked. Persons that have large dairies should always have a machine to work it. A large churning
