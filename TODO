A good way to get rid of some of the repeats might be to remove any items that occur only one time in the
whole dataset. This will get rid of things like "snow water" and "juice of the lemon" while hopefully keeping
things like "cold water" and "lemon juice".

Unfortunately, there isn't really a good way to guess at how many actually unique items will be lost by this
method.

Anyway, something to try maybe.
